Computational neuroscience research (SUDEP) with my mentor,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,Fall sophomore I began my first research project on machine learning and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). I mainly focused on applying machine learning models to offline features extracted from EEG and EKG data.,"This is directly related to my grand challenge of reverse engineering the brain. Machine learning has uses for both application and understanding. For application, we can develop a classificaiton model to identify cases of SUDEP. For understanding, we can understand what features led to a positive or negative test result, thereby giving more insight into the mechanisms behind SUDEP.","This was my first time doing legit research. It gave me a lot of exposure into what applied machine learning research is like. While it hasn't definitively made me decide whether or not I want to do research post-grad, it definitely made me better understand what research is like. Additionally, it gave me more insight into potential machine learning applications for healthcare.",8/20/2020,1/1/2022,"My work eventually led to a paper where I was credited 2nd author:

Student Athlete Alumni Networking Event,Professional Development,Student Activity/Event/Club,"As a student-athlete, I was able to attend a alumni networking event specifically for varsity atheltes. I attended one for tech jobs.","Admittedly, I do not think these are directly related to my grand challenge. At the time, I had interviews for summer software engineering internships. While these internship roles were not specifically related to reverse engineering the brain, the practical skills and knowledge I gained were transferrable to my research project. I attended this event to get tips on coding interviews.","The most important thing I learned from this event was admitting when I did not know something. When I interviewed for Facebook, I was very honest on my lack of knowledge and still got an offer. Additionally, another tip I learned was to just come off as friendly, since my interviewer is also evaluating me on whether they would be willing to work with me. Because of this, I was also successful in my internship search the subsequent year.",10/16/2020,10/16/2020,"One of the alumni, Sarah Lensing, worked at Snap.

Machine learning and chronic back pain,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,I started my capstone project on machine learning and chronic back pain. I am interested in applications for classificaiton and also understanding the mechansms behind chornic back pain.,"Similar to my first research project, this is directly related to reverse engineering the brain. I am to use machine learning to better understand the mechanisms behind chronic back pain. Additionally, this study uses a non-intrusive and affordable data collection procedure. This will help improve accessibility for chronic back pain patients.","This project was my first time working on preprocessing EEG data. This helped me better understand one of the biggest challenges with AI and healthcare - quality and quantity of clean/trainable data. 

My mentor invited me to see one of the medical students perform the data collection. Seeing where the data was coming from in-person made me more motivated to delve more into this research project.",9/1/2021,5/10/2023,"I don't have direct documentation for this project, but I can confirm that I've been working on it throughout my junior year.

Broadridge UX Design Internship ,Professional Development,Internship,"During this internship, I helped make sure Broadridge product websites were ADA compliant. I also put together a report in which I evaluated usability heuristics of the websites and made suggestions for improvement. I also helped prototype some new designs of the websites. (I did NOT use GLASS funding but the form won't let me submit unless I check the box.)","This was related to the tenth SDG, reduced inequality. One way to do this in the digital field is to improve usability of web media for all users, especially by ensuring websites are accessible and ADA compliant. The project regarding the product websites I worked on is strictly confidential, so I cannot share any reports or presentations that I made.","This internship helped me further my professional goals by providing me with a corporate experience and teaching me to work with a professional team. The project was very finance and business oriented, so I had to get used to unfamiliar terminology quickly. I felt that I learned many principles of UX design, as well as how designers can have a big impact on the functionality of a producr. My manager was also very helpful and gave me a lot of career related advice.

Good Research Conference by Colette Kolenda,Academic Excellence,Conference,This is a week long program of speakers and researchers. There were presentations on transitioning from academia to IX research in the field. I learned about best practices in UX research and the differences between human research in university versus in the corporate world.,Learning how to do proper human research and explore the relationship between humans and computers will impact how emerging technologies are developed and how they are used to help people across the world. I believe this can have an impact on grand challenges like advancing personalized learning or improving VR. ,"A lot of what I learned in this conference can help me apply skills I've built in my design classes to research in the professional world. Personally, I hope to use what I've learned to devise better technological systems for learning. It helped me understand what kind of human computer interaction research I could potentially explore in academia and how that relates to the rest of the world.",6/13/2022,6/17/2022,https://goodresearch.joinlearners.com/,,n/a,Emerging Media,I found out about this from a fellow IDM student who is a year above me.,This conference took place remotely.,No,Spring/Summer Junior
VISIONS,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,I helped design paper pamphlets and media posts for a nonprofit in New York called VISIONS - Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired. These designs helped promote a new project that the organization was launching called In Plane Sight. ,"In this project, students who are visually impaired learn engineering skills hands-on by learning how to build a plane. This relates to UN Sustainable Development Goals number 4) Quality Education and 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth. Helping promote this project will help people with disabilities obtain a more engaging education by learning engineering skills. It will also help people of all abilities find full and productive employment.","I was able to use my professional digital design work in this service task, which was really encouraging. I hadn't considered before that I could use design skills in a service-oriented manner. This experience also taught me that it is perfectly acceptable and easy to just reach out to nonprofits and ask what you can do for them. It was really fun to be able to use my skills to help a project that would help others. It made the work I was doing really meaningful. Not only did I get a project out of it for my professional portfolio, but I learned new skills and felt like I developed as a person as well.",4/4/2022,5/4/2022,https://visionsvcb.org/,Instagram post - 1 (v2).png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/RaG4YnSd08DkD0BW440GfQ/mW4LdrqObYA0wNhlcaEL-9ay-psy91QSCvdVZZ3uH4Jn5ET1aw3iKYTm7LjUuwfb7LLc3NyBhuMN6-6XYLqaCPCTuU_AYvGaN-TB2tDZnkZ50IWAB6Rodwr2EpR27WILjQ8SfkublVH0kDPwl_kucAHicdYOZSWi-BxYPy-69E4/NBskDf9HPgkEyYz19b_S03EPoxXxHZLB4UQq-N2xvgI),Instagram post,"Emerging Media, Health","In our GLASS seminar course, we had to complete service hours.

Study Abroad Semester,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I studied abroad for my spring semester of junior year in Seoul, Korea at Korea University. While I was there, I learned a lot more about the language and culture of Korea by going on trips with other students, joining clubs, and immersing myself as much as possible. I was also able to study some interesting topics in psychology and cognitive science from a different perspective while I was there. ","I believe this experience can indirectly relate to a lot of the goals. For one, it relates to a quality education because I personally was able to receive a more enriching and global education through the GLASS program which would have been more difficult to do otherwise. It also relates to goal number 10, which is to reduce inequality within and among countries. By understanding more about another culture and teaching people in another country about myself, citizens of our two countries can learn more about each other, which hopefully contributes to reduced prejudice and fear of others simply because of unfamiliarity or cultural differences. This is especially important when developing new technologies and engineering because those in charge have power over whether biases are encoded into certain designs.","I believe I gained a lot of personal development from this experience. I learned about etiquette in a new country and even discussed politics and the economy on a global level with students my age who have had a completely different experience from me. Academically, I improved on a second language and expanded my knowledge of psychology and cognitive science and how that can apply to designing for human use. This also will help me in my professional endeavors to learn more about human-computer interaction and do more research. Overall, it was a fun and enriching part of my GLASS college experience.",2/9/2022,12/15/2022,"https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do

NYU Tandon Undergraduate Summer Research Program,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,I worked under the Aydil Group of the Chemical Engineering department on synthesizing single and double perovskite crystals. The crystals were deposited on glass films which were then characterized using various techniques such as x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence. The purpose is to make a crystal that can be placed on solar cells to increase their efficiency by up to 200%. I am now writing a research paper that will be published in academic journals and will be presenting a research poster. ,"This connects to the UN's goals of increasing the use of renewable energies to combat climate change. These perovskite crystals have the potential to turn the range of energy from the sun that solar cells can't ""absorb"" energy from, into energy that is in the absorbable range. This is the single best way that scientists have found so far to surpass the current efficiency of solar panels. If this were to one day go to market, it would decrease the number of solar panels that we need area for since each panel will be 200% more efficient than now. ","This experience has given me the skills I need to pursure a higher education degree in which I will be doing research on my own. It helped me decide that I do in fact want to pursue a PhD before I pursue a job in industry, and it gave me a network of scientists and doctorate candidates that will serve me this next year at Tandon and beyond. I am now a much better engineer because of the skills in prooblem solving I have learned. I also now have a better idea of what I would like to study in my masters or PhD programs and it has allowed me to explore an area of materials science that I would have never otherwise.

Kickstart Europe 2022 ,Professional Development,Conference,This component was a very good professional development opportunity for us as it allowed us to learn from the current VIPs in international tech particularly about how they plan to adhere to future sustainabilty standards. It also gave us an insight into the many ways in which what we learn at Tandon/in the US are far in advance from what we saw at the conference. ,"This was very connected to the SDGs as it was a way for leaders to showcase their company's SDGs, how those related to global sustainability goals, and the steps that they were taking to meet these goals. This was also relevant for me particularly because many of the companies that were showcased were in the energy generation sector and they presented ideas that seemed very outdated compared to what governments (aka the public sector) are doing in the European Union. This gave me a sense that perhaps the biggest disconnect between planning for and reaching our goals is the public-private sector gap. ","This experience was quite enlightening as it showed me that what we learn at NYU is really beyond-preparing us to do big things in sustanability no matter what industry we go into.

"Technology, Culture, and Society Department Writing Award",Academic Excellence,Award,"I was awarded the commencement award for the TCS department at Tandon for my writing on the sustainable and circular life cycle of solar panels. This writing was part of my Junior HUSS elective titled ""Fundamentals of the Energy Transition"". ","My writing is very clearly related to the goals in renewable energy set forth by the UN. If we want to achieve a truly circular economy in solar installations we also have to consider how solar cells are treated at the end of their life, how they are disposed of, and how we can ensure that the toxic waste they generate is properly addressed. While the benefits of solar panels outweigh the garbage that they produce, this is still very imporant to consider. ","Writing this paper was very eye-opening as it introduced me to the back-end of sustainability that is not very often talked about when we speak of sutainability, renewale energy, and cirular economies. It also interested me enough to pursue research in solar energy this summer, albeit from a different aspect.

NYU Paris Study Abroad ,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"This summer (2022), I studied abroad for the first time. It was a great experience and I got to meet a lot of new people from NYU programs that I haven't had a chance to interact with before. In addition to completing my final humanities requirements, I also got to invest time into an area of interest which has always been important to me (production of film/TV shows) but which has been inaccessible because of my CS and math courseload. However, I was surprised to learn how computer science, specifically ML and big data, is starting to play a big role in predicting the success of new movies and TV series. ","My GLASS project is dedicated to finding relevant medical applications for emerging AR/VR technology, specifically using AR technology to help Parkinson's Disease patients gain easy access to non-invasive rehabilitation methods. Since NYU Paris did not offer any STEM classes or any medical courses related to my project, I could not make any progress pertaining to my target UN Grand Challenge. However, I did think about how emerging media (specifically, the often-overlooked cultural and psychological impact that movies and TV shows can have) plays a role in both educating the public and changing perceptions about societal inequalities. For instance, in my production class, I learned about how certain underdevelopped or underfunded countries use tax incentives to attract foreign production companies. As it turns out, having a popular or significant movie/TV show made in a country not only creates lucrative new jobs for locals, but it also gives local writers or creative minds a chance to publicize important social inequalities which would otherwise get no attention. Although this does not relate with my Parkinson's research project, I did get to put a lot of thought into two Grand Challenges which I have not had a chance to seriously consider in the past. ","For my academic goals, this trip helped me complete my two remaining humanities requirements so that I can graduate this coming semester. I ended up enrolling in Business of Producing (Stern) and Expatriate Literature, both of which I really enjoyed and which gave me a final chance to take a Stern and CAS class (all of my classes for my previous and next semesters are at Tandon). I especially enjoyed the production class since I got to learn about a field that has always interested me, but which I have not gotten much exposure to because of my CS/Math degree. From a personal development standpoint, this trip helped a lot because it showed me a broader range of opportunities of areas that I could work in after graduation. Also, I got to meet a lot of students who are working in these areas, and it's always nice to get to meet people from the broader NYU community. Finally, this trip helped me practice my French which I found to be super helpful, even though I don't plan on working in France after I finish school. ",5/21/2022,7/11/2022,"The document I uploaded is the final pitch deck for a TV series I proposed to my class. I know it is not STEM-related, but it elaborates on how my study abroad experience had an impact on my professional and personal development goals. ",,.,Emerging Media,"Ever since I got my acceptance letter to NYU, I have always wanted to participate in their expansive global studies program. I heard about how many campuses and courses NYU offers in countries that I had never visited before, and I knew this would be a great way to diversify my education and to perhaps discover a new field where I might want to work in the future.

Institute for Human Services (IHS) - Hawaii,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Prepared and served meals in the Honolulu men's homeless shelter.

Assisted with admin work for the family shelter which helped us understand the mental problems faced by individuals going through homelessness. 

Toured their mental rehabilitation center where they get the opportunity to learn how to get back on their feet and use their passion to create an income.","I am interested in the brain(Grand Challenge- Reverse Engineering of the Brain) and human health in general so it was a good opportunity to tour the mental health facility in the shelter and to speak to some of the patients to understand what they are going through psychologically

The activity dealt with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 1 and 2, which are to achieve no poverty and no hunger.

IHS achieve these goals by providing meals to those in need and creating space in their shelters for the homeless. Unlike other homeless shelters, they cater to their mental health and spend time getting to know them, while teaching them and their children how to build a future for themselves. This will help eradicate poverty as they are given the tools to get back on their feet and are released once they are ready and have completed their ""training.""

It was a great experience for Joy and I as it allowed us to see things from a different perpective and think of many possible ways to help the homeless near us.","The experience opened my eyes to see the complexness of homelessness and how it affects all parts of the individual's life. I got to understand the importance of service work and the impact it has on the people you help. The little you do for others can go a long way for them.

Huellas de Pan Volunteer Experience,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"We volunteered at Huellas de Pan, an institution in Cancún that has a feeding program for children in the area. The children in the area are battling malnourishment and lack of balanced diets due to poverty so the company Huellas de Pan was started to bridge that gap and give school going children an opportunity to get nutritious meals for breakfast and lunch. They have a facility close to a school so the children are taken there in between classes. They also collect toys and other donations such as clothes to give to the children.","This is related to UN Sustainable goal 1 and 2: No Poverty and Zero Hunger. Huellas de Pan was working hard to ensure the children get meals every day which also puts some relief on their parents who will not have to worry about getting their children another meal. This allows money in the household to be allocated to something else, as they do not have much.","The experience allowed me to experience a different culture as  have never been to Mexico. It allowed me to listen to and understand people of a different culture and to see the day to day struggles that they face. Even within different cultures, the main problems afced are the same. After my volunteer experience last year in Honolulu, which made me see how the organization was battling homelessness, I was able to apply some lessons I learnt there to this volunteer experience. In Honolulu they not only gave the homeless meals and shelter but were teaching them how to farm and do other activities so that they are able to fend for themselves once they depart.

It provided an unparalleled opportunity to go beyond the surface and really experience a different way of life.

Tanzania Pre-Health Medical Volunteer Trip,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Mount Meru Referral Hospital is the main regional hospital in Arusha and the second largest public hospital in Tanzania. Other pre-health students at NYU and I went to Arusha to volunteer in the hospital for two weeks. During day shift, I worked in the labor and delivery room and observed C-sections, delivered 12 babies myself after being trained, assisted stitching a first-degree vaginal tear, and performed the routine postnatal care such as clamping and cutting the umbilical cord and clearing the baby’s airway using nasopharyngeal suction. I worked in the emergency room during night shift and got the opportunity to cannulate patients and administer drugs and fluids, insert a catheter, perform an interrupted suture on a minor injury, learn my ABCs and other procedures done on arrival. I was a translator on the trip and had to ask the patients questions from the foreign doctors and relay the information which taught me what questions are important and what to look out for in an emergency. I also spent some time in the pediatric wards as a translator collecting patient history from their family members and relaying the information to the doctors. One of the days we went out to a village to give free consultations and provide medication for minor cases and referrals if anything was worrisome, and I was a translator there too and took patient’s vitals.","It is related to Goal no.3 which aims to provide access to healthcare services to all. The community had a shortage of octors and we were able to provide addition help to the docttors, to give the patients the best care they can get","Last summer I got the opportunity to be a medical intern and shadow in Mount Meru Hospital in Arusha, Tanzania. Over the two weeks I spent there, I worked in the labor and delivery unit during the day and the emergency room and pediatric ward at night. This experience holds special significance to me, and I believe the person I was before the trip and after are two different people. Firstly, I got to work very closely with the doctors who guided me step by step on the childbirth and delivery process and eventually pushed me to take the lead and deliver my first baby and then 12 more after that. I was also allowed to assist the doctor stitch a first-degree vaginal tear and learned how to care for the baby post-delivery. During night shift, I worked closely with an emergency doctor who trained me in suturing and guided me in performing an interrupted suture on a motorcycle accident patient when they needed all hands-on deck and had to focus on more serious cases. The importance of communication and collaboration became very apparent to me as I was acting as a translator for the foreign doctors and fellow colleagues that I travelled with who relied on me to find out the patient’s history and to communicate with them. I say I am a different person now because everything became very real. Interacting with the patients and especially their family showed me the pain and frustration they felt. This was a very vulnerable and unpleasant moment in their life and they simply just have to trust and hope that the doctors are able to help. In that moment when have the patient in your hands you realize your position and responsibility to provide the best care as you may be the one who determines how the next stage of their life and family’s life will look.",8/14/2023,1/26/2024,https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/glass-participants-shine,IMG_0346.HEIC (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/-hMKAMh5T2piwcMuuEhgsA/r_ddT-3kJdIjvOpsvUNBLt_y1RJcicrRjPb6nmHo8CI3QSmHzO59BhI_DaOvGqNfyvB9t6OoQeHr_ls8R64Tc0SRQEUXpo5d6JlAXMJvctYzZHHexyWfe6Dlq_U6xoa-_dX1f3o-FcJn-gUvrDhsrw/5H8m5-TM3aDeZR6jmUg19KCLSHCUGtuAGpHDlmWRQLM),"Arusha, Tanzania 2023 Holding a Baby I deliveredd",Health,Through Sara and Kat who are part of the Tandon Pre-health team,"Arusha, Tanzania",Yes,Spring/Summer Junior

My passion for teaching and curiosity will allow me to continually learn and broaden my knowledge to discover new things that my patients or colleagues could benefit from, and I will pass the knowledge down to future professionals who could build on it and discover more. This experience has also taught me patience which is important in the healthcare industry and how to recognize the limits of your competence and ask for help when needed, as some students ask questions that you do not know the answer to and you must be honest with them, admit that you do not know and get back to them later after asking a professor or doing research.

My experience in Abu Dhabi definitly demonstrated firsthand to me the power institutions have to change lives for the better if they serve the group without losing focus on the individual.",My experience traveling abroad definitely has cleared up some subconscious fears of working outside the US. I think part of the fear was that I didn't know what kinds of opportunities existed outside of the US. Talking to professors at Abu Dhabi was very helpful in addressing that ignorance.

I helped set the farm back up including checking up on the aquaponics tank when we were cycling it for the new fish. ,"I can connect this experience to the zero hunger development goal. As climate change takes effect in the coming years, traditional agricultural practices may become less reliable as harsh weather events become more severe (hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, etc.). Vertical farming and aquaponics presents a possible solution to this situation as it can take place indoors under artificially controlled conditions. This style of farming is both more water efficient and has also shown to grow healthier crops, faster, for certain kinds of plants such as microgreens and berries. ","Working on the farm, coming up with ideas, and working on a team in a long term project was all very enlightening.

Peeramid at Tandon Future Labs,Professional Development,Internship,"I did a paid internship during my Spring 2023 semester with a startup at Future Labs called Peeramid. Mainly, I learned what their professional workflow was and also learned about ios and android app development.","Peeramid is a mental health app where students can learn about how to deal with mental health issues as well as share their thoughts and experiences. I believe this could fall under Good Health and Well being, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Quality Education. This is because mental health is a vital component to these UN development goals. ","Doing this internship made me realize how difficult it may be to balance a real job and going to school. I barely had any time to work on my internship and school work while also balancing my other priorities and physical and mental health. I believe that in the end, I did a mediocre job at all of these things and could have excelled if I had decided to drop one or two activities.

We're both excited to learn about new Microsoft applications directly from the developers at this conference. ,"This pertains to Partnerships for Goals and Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The Microsoft Build conference brings together many people from different areas of Tech. At the conference, the Microsoft company demonstrates new innovations and tech that it has been working on. This increases inclusivity, awareness, and sharing of knowledge just by virtue of bringing all these talented people together. ","This is my second time going to a conference geared towards showing off new innovations and tech. The last time I went to the Computer Vision Summit in Boston, I came back to NYC with my eyes opened to what cutting edge technologies are actually being implemented, or will be implemented, in industry.

Karibu Foundation Volunteering,Global Competency,Volunteer Event/Experience,"I volunteered in Arusha, Tanzania under the Karibu Foundation. I volunteered at Canosa Medical Dispensary, where I helped doctors take patient measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate and enter data into their system. I also helped out at Osiligi Orphanage where I added to a PowerPoint presentation to include new arrivals at the orphanage. I also did construction work at a school called Mother's Mercy where I hauled and laid bricks and prepared vegetables.","This connects to the sustainable communities UN development goal. In Arusha, I learned about the Massai people as well as city life in that specific area of the world. To create sustainable communities, the exploration of other cultures is essential. Understanding may not be complete, though exposure and being comfortable with other's differences is essential when coming to agreements/compromises.","This experience taught me about some issues that people face in their day to day lives that I was not aware of. Technology is advertised to us in the US as cutting edge and pushing the boundaries of what is computationally possible with quantum and AI. However, I saw how many people in Arusha didn't even have access to a laptop or clean water, much less fiber-optic connections to the internet or cutting-edge computing.

ITB X NYU Indonesia J-Term Sustainability Course,Academic Excellence,Special Course,I went to Indonesia to participate in the 2024 J-term course about Sustainability hosted by SBM ITB. We learned about Indonesian culture and visited projects to learn about sustainable farming and communities. ,"This component connects to the Sustainable Communities/Cities as well as Life on Land SDG's. At the Teras Hijau project, we learned how the ibu ibu's (older women who worked there) implemented a circular economy by taking care of where they sourced materials, produced products locally, and recycled their organic and inorganic trash. Their mission was to not only educate their community about sustainable and healthy living, but to provide a place for people to physically participate in a circular economy/society. We also went to a project named Sokola Motekar started by a man named Denni who had the dream of building a community that had a more sustainable way of living than western/modern cities or communities. We learned how the community educated its kids in a non-traditional environment as well as how it built relationships and camaraderie between members by hosting community events and spaces.","This experience showed me that a modern, productive, and self-sustaining community doesn't have to always look like New York City which seems to prioritize efficiency and short-term gain above everything. The people at Teras Hijau and Sokola Motekar made do with what little they had and found purpose in helping each other and in coexisting with the environment around them. This experience exposed me to a different kind of thinking than that with which I've been surrounded my whole life.

Senior Design Project: CTRL-X,Academic Excellence,Other,For my senior design project I worked with a group of 4 other members. We created a automated penetration testing framework that is meant to make cybersecurity more available to everyone.,"This project had a connection to the NAE grand challenge ""Securing Cyberspace"". Our project allowed the user to simply fill out the ip of the network or machine they wanted to run a penetration test on, and then automatically executed a penetration test and generated a full report on the given network/machine. Usually, this process takes a cybersecurity specialist a couple of hours of busy work to accomplish (especially the report-writing), and we were able to use AI to automate it. Our project allows people that aren't acquainted with cyber security to find vulnerabilities in their devices and networks that could potentially be exploited. ","The experience definitely gave me a better understanding of what working with a team of equals in software development might look like. It was almost like a 3 month-long hackathon. It also allowed me to practice communication, setting reasonable expectations, and task delegation.

Study Abroad University of Newcastle,Global Competency,Study Abroad,I studied abroad during the spring of 2022. I spent six months in Australia studying and also familiarizing myself with Aboriginal history. ,"This study abroad experience covered a wide range of the Sustainable Development Goals and grand Challenges since I was working with agriculture while also working with the human side of things. I studied affordable and safe energy through thermodynamics and I explored human relationships with each other and the environment through my Aboriginal education class--namely how to reduce inequalities and ensure equal education and health for everyone. I also spent time exploring Australia's wildlife and farming industry to better understand how it can be improved for a better future. In addition, I gained a better understanding of how global industries opperate and how these industries affect all other aspects of the Grand Challenges. My study abroad essentially covered every single challenge and gave me insights into the problems and potential solutions for each one. At the end, I even wrote a news article on the subject. ","After spending so much time in Australia, I have decided to shift my future career in the United States into one in Australia. I found that research in Australia was far less elitist, and I enjoyed my educational experience there far more than in the United States.  I also found jobs were far more connected there, and it is much easier to shift between industries with one degree than even in the United States, so I may also explore other scientific fields outside of just genetic agricultural research. I enjoyed the culture more, and I found people there were much more progressive on social issues. I intend to work in GMO acceptance and research in Australia in the future now, and I also intend to get my Ph.D. there as well after having studied abroad and experiencing life there..

Gowanus Canal Conservancy ,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Bi-monthly, I work at the Gowanus Canal Conservancy to help with litter pick up and planting. I also help to sort recycling and identify invasive or native plants in NYC rain gardens. ","Volunteering at the Gowanus Canal Conservancy mostly relates to environmental stability and clean water. The purpose of the rain gardens is to filter polluted rainwater as many of the species we have planted can naturally recycle toxins. We also collect trash in hopes that the garbage will not enter our waterways, and we focus on replanting native plants where we are able to to give New Yorkers a cleaner environment. We may also be improving the health of New Yorkers by providing cleaner air and cleaner streets during our work. We occasionally do political advocacy as well, and I was at such an event where we begged the city to allow the EPA to continue their project at the sacrifice of our land, so we were helping to create a partnership for the environment while also advocating for it at the expense of our land. ","I have learned extensively about the importance of native species, and one common topic I heard from other cleaners was that farms in California/the west were completely unsustainable because the crops used are not meant for that region. I, of course, believe anything can be engineered to survive anywhere, but that raised a good question regarding regional farming. Should I instead focus on regional identification and farming? Would, for example, rice instead of being engineered to need less water be better engineered to survive more salt and be planted off of the coasts of California?

Co-director of the Urban Food Lab,Leadership Development,"Research/Lab Work,Special Course","I started out as just a member of the Urban Food Lab, and now I am the co-director. I work to ensure we produce research and give students the experience they are searching for with our VIP project. ","The Urban Food Lab is focused on studying how we can reduce or remove microplastic and produce high-quality food entirely indoors. We are working alongside the EPA to reduce water pollution and ensure that everyone will have microplastic and nitrite free water to drink. We also believe that quality food improves medicine, and although we are not authorized to do human trials, we hope that the impoved nutrient content of our food helps to end global hunger. We also want to research how to reduce the opreating cost of our system, reducing the income inequality that is access to fresh, great food. Our lab does not focus on economic growth, however, as we are focused just on the human and health side of things. ","Through the Urban Food Lab, I learned that not all lab work is done in an insanity-inducing sterile environment. I was able to interact with mechanical components and use my engineering knowledge to help build a great lab for urban sustainability research. I now feel even more confident in my abilities to lead a research team, and it has put me on the right path to one day being in charge of my own lab like Professor Pinkerton or Professor Boeke.

The topics discussed provoke thought about economic development, addressing inequalities, and effective leadership structures, among others. Obviously, this all takes place in a simulated setting, but I think this kind of thinking is crucial to instill in students early on, so they can further develop their critical thinking skills down the road. We were also raising money for a charity aimed at reducing hunger and providing food to those in need, which also supports the UNSDG. ","Every MUN conference I facilitate continues to be a great experience in leadership, teamwork, collaboration, and communication. The months-long planning and development process leading up to the actual conference allowed me to research a topic, write a useful background guide, and create various character bios for the delegates to use. As a humanities person in an engineering school, I very much appreciate these opportunities to return to topics that are far less analytical. These conferences continue to emphasis to me that I ultimately would like to work in an interdisciplinary role, instead of something solely technical.

To do such a thing, it is useful to see what others have attempted in the past to create intelligence. Having a base knowledge of AI techniques also allowed me to consider how to augment some with biologically-inspired changes. For example, using neural networks as a simulation of the brain is not quite accurate; however, it is a good starting point, with room to add complexity such as interactions of nodes in a group. It also proposes certain challenges, such as whether one should simulate astrocytes in a simulation of neurons.","This was a useful course to gain a base understanding of the field of AI as a whole. From here, I was able to look into where I could specialize to best aid my goal. Machine learning is a promising path, but it is not the only path forward; many AI tasks accomplish interesting subproblems that can be applied to other challenging areas, such as optimization of a computer architecture based on its most common operations. Also, this course helped me to find that I quite like building AIs, which validates my career decisions.",9/7/2021,12/23/2021,I have documents for my project.

AIM Haptics Lab,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,"My task was to create a virtual reality classroom environment where a professor could interact with a student through touch. We wanted to achieve this using a prototype haptic jacket created by the AIM lab. My contributions included rigging and setting up the human 3D model for use with the Kinect SDK, and designing human models using MakeHuman. ","This project has the potential to aid in advancing personalized learning. The goal is to allow students to interact with professors in a way that is not possible with traditional online courses. Students who do not get enough out of Zoom courses could be helped by a closer-to-in-person interaction, and in a live setting the instructor can gauge an audience response better than through a screen without camera participation. This project, if completed, could also enhance education quality (SDG 4), as another goal was to allow for recordings of the professor which the student could play back whenever they need. ","This experience helped me to appreciate the effort that goes into a project that combines media, coding, and virtual reality with haptic feedback. Some of this difficulty came from the outdated technology we were using, and a lack of alternatives.

Global Tech Experience - Data Analytics,Professional Development,Special Course,"Over the course of this spring semester, I participated in the Global Tech Experience, learning data analytics! In the first part we learned excel, and in the second part we learned Tableau.","Taking a global tech experience course in data analytics, particularly focusing on Excel and Tableau, has significant connections to several UN Sustainable Development Goals and Grand Challenges. Firstly, it aligns with Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by equipping individuals with the skills necessary to leverage technology and data for innovation and sustainable development. Secondly, it contributes to Goal 4 (Quality Education) by promoting access to high-quality education in data analysis, which is increasingly crucial in various sectors for evidence-based decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, proficiency in data analytics supports Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by enhancing employability and enabling individuals to contribute effectively to economic development through data-driven insights and solutions. Lastly, by fostering an understanding of data-driven approaches to address societal challenges, such as poverty, healthcare access, and environmental sustainability, the course indirectly supports multiple other Sustainable Development Goals by providing tools for informed policy-making and resource allocation.","Through the Global Tech Experience, I have gained a new perspective on the importance of giving and receiving feedback, as well as building relationships. 


Every week, when we are tasked to work on Excel or Tableau workbooks, and sent off into our breakout rooms on Zoom, it is up to us (the group) to choose to work and learn together. Working together is always easier when we build relationships with one another, learning about where each person is based, what school they go to, and what brought them to this experience. In addition, as we are all working together, we strengthen our relationships too.


Since we all come from different backgrounds, we can have different approaches to assigned tasks. In Excel, there were multiple ways to create the same output. (In Tableau, so far there only seems to be one way to do things). Balancing the different approaches and the “right approach” involves giving and receiving feedback. I’ve learned to take a step back, and realize that we’re all here in this experience to learn. Thus, whenever someone gives me feedback, they do so with intentions to help me (not to comment on the lack of my skill). Conversely, whenever I give someone else feedback, they are able to develop their skill. It has been very encouraging and a safe environment so far, to work in my groups — everyone has been very kind and hardworking, and that has set the standard for me to uphold. 


This skills of building relationships as well as giving and receiving feedback are skills that I will continue to develop for the rest of my life. It is healthy to develop assertive communication needs, both personally and in the workplace!  I hope to bring these skills into my workplace by investing in relationships with everyone (of various roles, backgrounds, interests, and skillsets). I see and prioritize the value of working with different people, because innovation happens when you combine different perspectives and create something new! In addition, it is important to always have an open conversation about things that others can improve on, as well as things that I can improve on. Assertive communication is the only way that everyone can grow, and feedback does not speak to my value as a person. Instead, it is an opportunity to deepen trust between coworkers, and develop a product. I plan to enter the biotechnology industry, which involves a lot of communication and collaboration, and I firmly believe that the intercultural skills that I have developed through the Global Tech Experience equip me to enter the field with confidence and excitement!

International Health Center,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Assisted with program planning / organisation for events and training sessions addressing the psychological effects of homelessness. 
Prepared and served meals in one of their shelters.","This experience mainly dealth with the UN's Sustainability Development Goals 1 and 2 which are no poverty and no hunger. The International Health Center (IHS) in Hawaii provides various forms of support to members of society who are underserved and vulnerable. This includes: 

●  Providing families, women, men and children with shelter as well as a day care center so the children can learn 

●  Providing therapy and counseling to address the mental health challenges experienced by the homeless such as schizophrenia. 

●  Providing medical care for those who are sick as well as psychiatric help. 

●  Rehabilitating and integrating drug users and the homeless into society so that they can be self sufficient and empowered. This was achieved through skill training such as teaching them how to start and operate hydroponic gardens as well as the collection of donations for beneficiaries. 

It is evident that IHS provided a broader range of services to the community. 

Chantelle and I had worked under Leona and had assisted with preparations for their mental health training as well as the serving food to people in their men’s shelters. In total, we have completed 11.5 hours of community service as of the end of spring break. ","From this experience we witnessed the challenging and complex homelessness is not just the physical aspects but also the mental and emotional effects it has on the people and those they know. As well as the difficulties they experience in attaining the resources they need such as therapy for instance. We were able to hear the various stories of those affected and how these organizations had helped them. Therefore, helping communities is not just about giving them physical resources but also providing them with the necessary skills, resources and guidance so that they can be integrated back into society and eventually become self-sufficient.

- Be bold and ask for what you want. Here she discussed how her choice to request to try different positions within the firm and not being afraid to speak out led to her being in the position she is now. She also brought up an interesting article that discussed how women are often reluctant to apply for a job when they do not feel 100% qualified while men apply to jobs they feel 60% qualified for. So she encouraged the audience to take a risk because it may be worth it in the end. 
- She also discussed the significance of transferable skills and the value of remaining keen and open to learning. This was evident through her life story as she was a CS major who decided to enter a less traditional job in investment banking. 
- Lastly, she discussed the importance of owning your success as a woman in male-dominated fields and the significance of being intentional about your progress. ",11/2/2021,11/2/2021,https://blackgirlstechsummit.com,,NA,,Invited through Handshake ,Virtual,No,Fall/Winter Sophomore
NYU Summer Undergraduate Research Program ,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,Assisting with research that analyses the resistance of indigenous wastewater bacteria to common disinfectants used for water purification which is critical for public health.,"This address the UN Sustainability Goal 6 which focuses on water and sanitation. Monochloramine is typically used in water purification as a secondary step to prevent the regrowth of micro-organisms that were previously inactivated in the first step of disinfection.  A recent study had shown that bacteria indigenous to the environment such as those found in wastewater were more resistant to chlorine disinfection (which is commonly used in the first step of disinfection) as compared to laboratory cultured bacteria (Mwatondo and Silverman, 2021). An open question is: what is the mechanism of resistance that is present in the environmental bacteria? Based on isolate experiments where bacteria from wastewater grown in the lab were more susceptible to disinfection compared to those in wastewater, it is hypothesized that the mechanism of resistance to disinfection stems from changes in physiology (Mwatondo and Silverman, 2021). Since monochloramine is typically used as a residual disinfectant for drinking water, it is important to understand the mechanism of resistance of indigenous bacteria to it. Here, we test the hypothesis that disinfection resistance of bacteria in the environment is induced through physiological factors. Three isolate colonies of Enterococci and Escherichia coli obtained from wastewater were cultured using the same procedure for laboratory-cultured bacteria where they were incubated in nutrient broths then rinsed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) prior to exposure to monochloramine. This is significant as Escherichia coli and Enterococci have been classified as biological indicators for the presence of disease-causing micro-organisms in fecal contaminated water. Furthermore, while there are several papers on disinfection with chlorine or sunlight, very few focus on monochloramine.  Based on preliminary experimental data, we expect that the wastewater-sourced bacteria grown in the lab will behave like laboratory cultured bacteria due to a lower resistance to disinfection compared to wastewater-sourced bacteria. This will further provide critical information on the mechanism of resistance employed by environmental bacteria so that more effective disinfectants and procedures are innovated.

Throughout the course we learned about the different ways global leaders and innovators can have a positive social impact around the world. I alos completed a project with fellow GLASS members. ,"During the course, our proffesor, Matt Karau, explained many of the issues with current global engineering projects. Matt explained that it is counter intuitive and not efficient to task engineers to solve a problem they do not understand and have not lived first hand.

Additially we worked on a project which focused on the Grand Challenge of Restoring and Improving Urban Infrustructure.

Being enrolled in Engineers for Social Impact, and seeing the negative effects of outside intervention without adequate reaserch, strengthened that foundation with evidence and experience. 

Secondly, I had the opportunity to submit a design proposal for a project to a competition called Wyakom ran by the government of Abu Dhabi. Our design proposal got selected as a finalist and we had the chance to present our idea to a board of industry proffesionals.

Grace Hopper Conference,Professional Development,Conference,The Grace Hopper Conference is a annual conference held for Women in CS. I was funded by NYU Tandon Dean's office to go and connect with employers in the career fair. ,"This relates to the goal of gender equality. With Women in CS being a marginalized community, the conference offers a way to connect with women with industry opportunities. Not only this, but the various talks held by women about how to navigate industry with confidence. This is a great way to uplift women in tech and enable leadership skills from inside out. ","Grace Hopper Reflection 

Attending the Grace Hopper Celebration, I was able to take part in the greatest gathering of women in technology around the world to come together for visibility, improvements, and networking in the field. During my time, I was able to attend the workshop for an introduction into threat vulnerability. In this session, to introduce engineers to the idea of threat intelligence, the hosts had an activity planned for finding 10 people in the room whose names start with A, finding 5 people in the room who worked at the same company, finding 5 people who arrived at the celebration on Tuesday, October 26, and lastly finding 1 person that fit all criteria. The goal of the activity was to both create an interactive experience among participants, but also explain threat intelligence concepts. Further, threat Intelligence is evidence-based information about cyber attacks that cyber security experts organize and analyze. We used pieces of the information gathered from the activity, to map out the entire story, or find a common narrative among all the pieces of information. This activity was great to break the ice, and network with industry experts. Additionally, I also was able to attend the SpaceX Topgolf Event, which was an amazing experience. During the event, I got to meet other conference attendees who were super cool, and got to talk to SpaceX engineers about their roles and responsibilities. One engineer, who worked in software testing essentially was the last line of defense of all system failures, and discussed her responsibility of carrying out intense simulations to account for thousands of variables and factors. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the passion and fervor these engineers had for their roles & how they have directly contributed to the company. 

Additionally, from the Expo Hall itself, I was able to network and talk to various engineers & recruiters, to learn more about their companies and present myself in the best way possible. More than this, I had the opportunity to increase my resilience with failure in the moment and to continue to seek all the possible opportunities. It was really easy to get discouraged after one conversation that may not have led to an interview or further steps, as you might feel like you did something wrong. But going in with a head strong mindset to seek opportunities that may not be suitable for you was the best learning opportunity in terms of handling rejection. In both my personal life and professional life, I know that handling rejection is something that will always continue to persist, and expanding the horizons of seeking uncomfortable ventures that may lead to rejection is an extremely valuable experience in itself. In terms of my professional goals, I am graduating a semester early, and I have been pretty vague with myself of what the future looks like and what the short-term goals in the year ahead may store. I think the conference made me more driven to plan these goals, and despite failure, having the goals and timeline to eventually achieve them is what has most changed for me. Additionally, I also have mapped out different outcomes and opportunities for back up plans which makes me feel more confident and se

cure in the process. Specifically, in regards to technical interview preparation, I definitely always feel the least confident in this part of the interviewing process, and interview preparation has moved up to an utmost priority for me. 

 Some feedback that I would like to share is in addition to the preparedness, having students ready for the mentality aspect of the conference should also be a huge emphasis. For instance, whether this is in regards to setting the tone about the right spirit to embody - talking about interviewing and offers in a good spirited way rather than having an expectation for others to have success in terms of landing interviews or jobs. Additionally, I know that a really key area for myself to feel a lack of confidence is in the technical aspects of technical interviewing, so offering resources way in advance to make sure to nail this aspect would be greatly appreciated. For example, various bootcamps or even online resources that would be recommended could be great to increase the confidence and preparedness of the women going. Another amazing resource for Tandon students would be to maybe have the opportunity to talk to a recruiter or engineer that will be attending the conference in advance, and hearing from them some tips and recommendations of how to best prepare for the conference and potential interviews especially in the career fair setting. I think these things can be invaluable to get first hand insight into what the expectations are, to prepare to meet these expectations, then be able to defy expectations on the conference day! All in all, thank you so much for the opportunity to attend this conference & for all the planning and logistics that went into making this possible. I really appreciate this platform Tandon has provided to connect to amazing women, engineers, and students.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I traveled abroad with my cohort of 16 other scholars. We were able to form strong international academic, social, and cultural bonds through participation in the NYU AD Study abroad program","This trip was critically important for my UN SDG ""Sustainable Cities and Communities"". As a largely desertified and oil-exporting society, the UAE has extensive work to do in improving the climate resilience of their dwellings for projected increases in heat, while also focusing on the mitigation of further climate disaster by reducing or nearly eliminating their society's economic dependence on oil. Both as a source of state rent, but also as a fundamental necessity to power their society. Learning about urban planning and development in the Gulf will definitely influence my final project.","Through my trip abroad, I was able to gain an incredible sense of personal fulfillment. I was able to stabilize many of the most chaotic aspects of my academic life and my personal wellbeing was better than ever in terms of diet and exercise. I was therefore able to go foreward more confidently and healthy in completing my academic and social goals.

CITIES Reclaiming Roads and Roofs Presentation,Academic Excellence,"Student Activity/Event/Club,Conference","I attended a student research presentation under the Center for Interacting Urban Networks(CITIES). The project, “Reclaiming Abu Dhabi's Roads and Roofs”, was part of an ongoing sustainability investigation into the effects on urban heat of various construction materials for road pavements, building rooftop materials, as well as water bodies and vegetation in the context of Abu Dhabi. ","The project, awarded by DMT, ASCE, and CITIES with a Research Internship to further develop its solution, aims to propose concrete steps Abu Dhabi can take to combat rising temperatures. The presentation comprised several segments on the Climate issues facing the city if it doesn’t find innovative ways to reduce the Urban Heat effect and create more resilient living conditions. These segments were followed by simulations of a scene in the city on Ansys software analyzing heat based on planning and construction changes. It works on the underlying technical research to making our cities more sustainable in the face of rising urban heat, fitting well under SDG 11","I was thoroughly impressed with the level of dedication and attention to detail they had in improving the simulations they were running through better material modeling, more accurate mathematical algorithms for objects, and factoring in various elements which change heat factors such as dust, windows,  etc. Some of the project’s limitations were in the computing power and detail on the more urban planning-oriented steps that carry more policy implications. Regardless, these types of projects are right up my sustainability alley, and it was nice to get a more technical look at the work that goes into urban developmental planning in contrast to the more humanities-oriented work that I tend to focus on. they had food and refreshments which is always a good way to win my favor.

Shaping Gowanus Research Paper,Academic Excellence,"Award,Research/Lab Work",I won the NYU Global Urban Showcase for the long form essay competition in 2022 for a research project I completed in Fall 2021,"This research project attempts to convey a region struggling to move forward, while addressing its polluted past, through the continuous process of shaping and defining an urban environment, in this case, Gowanus. I study various aspects of Gowanus' history and urban development through community-engaged research, in person observations, and academic analysis. These topics include the remediation of the Superfund site, environmental resilience in the flood prone neighborhood, the massive rezoning and redevelopment of the region, as well as the community and development dynamics.  ","Through this process, I directly connected with residents to intimately understand a community I didn’t know, from nostalgic interpretations of Gowanus’ character to the contrasting calls for change amongst residents. I was able to truly see the weight of public safety risks, the groundwork of community engagement, and the exhaustion of grappling with a centuries-brewing sludgy cocktail of systemic issues. But most importantly and fundamentally, this experience taught me that with some initiative, and a focus on learning from communities, these, seemingly abstract but vital, urban and environmental issues could become tangible, accessible, and be impacted in meaningful ways. This project took me inside people’s homes, offices, warehouses, and even boats-an experience which further invigorated my passion for and connection to the people of this city, and I feel so much more confident in navigating my own path as an environmental and community advocate because of it.

Volunteering with Bronx River Alliance,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience," Since October 2022, I’ve been an active volunteer and supporter for Bronx River Alliance, a Bronx-based environmental stewardship and community advocacy organization. I've helped their Ecology Restoration program by cleaning Starlight Park, a coastline recreational park in the Bronx, as well as helped out at food distribution events and participated in community building/engagement events with other volunteers. ","This experience reinforced how environmental public service and fostering sustainable cities and communtiies isn’t just about creating new green spaces. It is also a battle to protect and cultivate the existing greenery we benefit from, even with small acts of service.  Without weekly efforts to steward the park, river, and rain garden, the community would lose pleasant recreational and social space, as well as regulatory ecosystem services that reduce flooding and urban heat. Additionally, other aspects of community engagement and service with food distribution and stewarding urban foodway gardens help to reduce food insecurity and create more education and options around food in underserved areas.
 ","BRA’s deeply entrenched social justice and community-first values sold me on their vision, and the way they build social infrastructure, connection, and culture around caring for our public spaces allowed our partnership to blossom. Since, I’ve attended river recreational events, volunteered in their food giveaway, and have been supporting their various advocacy campaigns through civic engagement on community panels. These events have helped me feel more connected to the Bronx and helped me learn about different ways to serve and support a community. Soon, I’ll be working with their water ecology team to test and monitor water quality so I can become a watchful guardian of the community and river.

Columbia Resilient Coastal Communities Project Internship,Professional Development,Internship,"This past summer, I partnered with South Bronx residents through Columbia’s Resilient Coastal Communities Project(RCCP) to foster equitable and sustainable solutions to local flood risks and land use issues.  I worked with the community organization South Bronx Unite and the Earth Economic institute in WA to help forward local sustainability plans and goals to address coastal and community resilience amidst flood-risks and contamination.
 ","Sustainable coastal communities rely on strong planning, advocacy, and regulatory forces pushing for water quality and flood safety. Coastal resilience is important amidst climate change impacts of sea level rise and increasingly devastating storm conditions. Being able to improve our urban infrastructure and use nature-based solutions to improve communities' quality of life and safety is an important aspect of the path forward. Additionally, social services and community building are a vital part of making communities more resilient to disasters, so learning about and advocating for such was a critical SDG element of this work.","This program had an extensive impact on my future goals and personal development through research, community partnership, and networking connections.

Internship at NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development,Professional Development,"Internship,Employment/Job","As a Housing Policy Research and Analysis Intern at  NYC’s Department of Housing Preservation & Development(HPD) this semester, I used policy analysis, data science, and research skills to analyze problems and policy initiatives, communicate those findings, and help produce literature to address equity and sustainability issues on a local level.  ","HPD’s work is somewhat broad but generally centered around promoting affordable, sustainable, and equitable housing development. Sustainable and fair housing policies play a significant role in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Access to adequate housing is a fundamental human right, and ensuring sustainable and fair housing policies can have a significant impact on reducing poverty and inequalities, improving health and well-being, and promoting social stability.

Sustainable housing policies can help reduce carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote renewable energy use. Fair housing policies can promote social inclusion, reduce discrimination, and ensure access to safe and affordable housing for marginalized communities. 
","Working at HPD has helped me develop professionally by being my first experience working in a government organization. Being introduced to a municipal government agency, you get to learn a lot about how decisions are made, how projects are completed and collaborated on, and what the work culture is like for public servants. I also was able to reflect on government bureaucracy for the nuances and positive enclaves it can have systemically, but also for the nightmare it can be to work through when pushing for meaningful issues. I also know how to more effectively go through the process of being hired by a government agency so I can likely replicate this in the future with other career opportunities.

Volunteering Meal Service at Xavier Mission,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Since December, I volunteered for 4 hours one Sunday a month at Xavier Mission's Sunday Meal Service. This meal service has existed for decades and takes volunteers from all over to serve free meals, drinks, bus tables, and chat with residents in need. Most of the people receiving the meals are low income or unhoused.","Meal services and soup kitchens like Xavier Mission can play a vital role in achieving the SDGs, particularly Goals 1 and 2, which focus on reducing poverty and hunger, respectively, and Goal 3, which promotes health and well-being for all. These services provide a basic human need - food - to vulnerable populations, including the homeless, low-income families, and those affected by natural disasters or conflicts. Providing access to food through meal services and soup kitchens can help alleviate poverty and hunger, which are two of the primary targets of the SDGs.

Meal service and soup kitchens also contribute to promoting health and well-being, another SDG target. By providing nutritious meals, these services can help improve the physical and mental health of those in need. Additionally, they can contribute to reducing inequalities by ensuring access to food for marginalized communities, including women, children, and the elderly. However, they are not a long-term solution, and efforts must be made to address the root causes of poverty and inequality to achieve sustainable development.
 "," I think volunteering is such an important core tenant of community and public service because of the direct benefits and necessity of free resources and assistance. Personally, it feels very grounding to take time out of my schedule to pitch in and it reminds me that my time shouldn’t be entirely focused on my personal career and academic goals if I really want to build a life around helping others. I think it’s important to not so my time or labor as “too valuable” to use and help others when I can. It’s also been a satisfying experience for me because of all the uplifting and positive interactions I’ve had with guests or fellow volunteers. It’s even become an opportunity to practice emerging language skills with spanish and hopefully as I begin relearning Chinese as I’ve used language to converse or serve residents that may not know english very well.

This orientation conference brought together dozens of scholars, alumni, and industry professionals to engage with one another in leadership, professional development, and sustainability educational activities to propel our careers in public service.","13 Climate Action: This program was heavily oriented around the impacts of climate change on indigenous communities and ecosystems and how exploitation, extractive and consumptive land processes are intertwined with climate action and equality.

Good Health and Well-Being: by addressing environmental degradation's health implications, promoting sustainable practices. 

Clean Water and Sanitation: by advocating for responsible resource management and preventing pollution, ensuring access to clean water through a myriad of community and activist solutions requiring vocal and consistent leadership 

Reduce Inequalities: The disproportionate impact of climate change and environmental destruction on BIPOC Communities is a direct tie to institutional power and inequality that coached us on ways to restructure public leadership or think about issues for public good.","This was a really cool opportunity, I haven't gotten to be in an environmental conference or be surrounded by so many peers and mentors in my field pretty much at any point in college. Both due to covid, and to the relative newness I feel like I've existed in the environmental movement in my life, I haven't really been able to benefit from the inspiring and challenging aspects of confronting all the different paths and outlooks on your field, the world's issues, and your politics. It helped to instill leadership skills through group communicative and co-educative activities, and opportunities for professional development into public leadership. I think it helped to also recenter many of my public goals in intersectional struggles of indigenous people and black people. It's a great privilege so many non indigenous people get to benefit from this scholarship, but still at the expense of many indigenous students who could be given this money and deserve it, so there's some duty to make sure you're giving back and dedicating your efforts throughout whatever form of public leadership.

Tandon Global Stud Abroad: Argentina Identity and City Building,Global Competency,"Study Abroad,Special Course","This course explores the intersections of infrastructure, science, political history, urbanism, and development in Argentina. It investigates the creation, shaping, claiming, and contesting of identity, analyzing how societies construct identities for nation-building, expansion, and citizenship through the lens of Argentina and Latin American. This class covers various social and historical structures, including religion, class, race, gender, imperialism, and colonialism and its affect on urban form and characteristics through art, media, culture, infrastructure, policy, etc. Students participated in 2.5 weeks of tours, group presentations, discussions, and lectures from professionals in various fields of advocacy and public service.","This course aligns with UN SDGs, particularly Sustainable Cities and Communities, by examining urbanism's role in identity formation and politics that shift sustainable urban development models. It also connects to Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions by investigating how identity issues intersect with historical factors, of democracy, corruption, oppression, and dictatorship in Argentina. The course addresses Reduced Inequalities by critically assessing societal structures, including those related to class, race, ethnicity, nationality, and gender, and sheds light on disparities in identity construction. With its international exposure, the course cultivates global perspectives essential for prioritizing justice, equality, and sustainable urban development in the world. Students develop skills in research, analysis, and communication, enabling them to contribute effectively to these UN SDGs and foster positive change in complex societal contexts.","This course was super beeficial to growing my affinity and goals for how to study and live abroad and globally in the future. It was my first time going to Latin America and I've been very eager to explore a new country and environment using Spanish, which I've been learning and practicing for much of th epast year. Honing my spanish speaking, listening, and interpersonal skills were probably some of the most important personal development goals. It was so cool to make the amount of connections I did on this trip and I'm excited to explore LA more in the future based on the reassurance of my spanish and personal navigation skills. I didn't know the language a year ago, and I'm glad I took steps to expand my ability to connect with more people and perspectives. I also really enjoyed starting my research project on Afro-diasporic experiences in Argentina in order to expand the potential for cross-solidarity experiences and drawing connections on shared systemic struggles.",1/3/2024,1/19/2024,https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/study-abroad/short-term/tandon-short-term-programs,"IMG-0298.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/DsiqaI6DfKT-oNaVZrpOzA/r2wq2-mAnB43L6h8JX7p5D0eoSwJ2wpiBOY3VdGEAFmWzDHnMVQhZHyiz8Y5nhjmSDBBFKPrkcTv0ymdZJzv1-mqht4dpAVz-d25B2g3Y6NATWBYhMo2a5A2CjdPR4728gVT5tybQLIqubTOQESHfw/zFZVe-YF5e1vGOmxvT6RqOQvCV03pAgwh2a_JJpHN9E),IMG-6574.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/hfoxCpHBB6zsnmZHovvBQw/Xm6ypPPUHU6WtaeRCoVFKKGAxRQQqlghOGfbS-02n8wo5IiqFabak1rVn-Bw1nJfwWX7zwYeNk8zq6B2Db1KkCwx4u6XmWZJ2cGy3fQUGz60V1RkhzBCK5hJF21jsy4NkPXw7FY-eM3QRTsCMIFeHw/TbjP04QVnmDyPexOrkrH7v48ZMGkgBMyoeJEOErsOcw),IMG-6573.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/S-7UkRgWHf7N4XehbwsykA/_oeqpFgBtKp1p0sZIA8MN1yzTkjPEWV9FCfTgi2-lkgWJe1NN_TQaG-wMc9AIJAhYGNda4qaMGm4QHqvbxTbuleuJ5mstVwL944kJ29ucNQcKY5cVzF1TBCiEjYN7rl2AuIcb6KrVxq2mHWzrDulTw/1nRq_tMrYiXtxu7r-4T_tFzjEEzJ_No3s2ewIQPkQJA),IMG-6299.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/lXgVH_kvgHON16agWjuRjg/mGelsZ2a9wJRJ1G-mv8J8X19kOXDpkbKlULGO-rCD75W9drA-wMbCYGWZ3ZNs5nNKPv7KOLaEuOmV3424h1MWxoNPV9hPjm9PRthvvVLFzHlSvSptUgCMHy7iYl2kf_KMun_qbbDS7XhtSyHwxR29w/b-QBS1KIjMVSpGqdns613ZmCO9eiVGAFZEM9MtBYrFA),IMG-6111.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/00kAXF2ycVgh8ygw99sheg/-i3ih56Lp69MmsEloZUMkt7LrpgIXJmK6jzKmXBdPE9BaZPw9nDLwXqh-VYAfV3XZTnLjEajL2OTVUIOb-hBXIQaxgHRECyBAu9_yk81vTKeAjhggCSiNh4RpPUwNh7316aXgj_VCE71s9dNmLlJuA/KPSI5pbwp_BDjTzSWPNGiJBnFHWwU2traA4EzZ1uRek),IMG-5609.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/adAB3AMIGKN2zva4IfxLIw/OleiCvThN2Qs0xSoCunXZP-E3fc6y2rBHR92N_3RPR2Gn0GrsHJOXala2gJlVWballSQCQawNz9yDC6C9YkRo2EjcAuiMihFm1ioyd6KfY3jjrhQIzejqnjxaKXc2vaPdnf7mvtyE6YQTCOxndow5g/TLIlHKANoSNTv6b_l8kH29sm0SdXz6d3458hvjL6Nk8),IMG-5170.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/y4fuCheoMt7PP6kdkxdUkA/iP2Be9WK1oMXFw5h2pFHxvezD34axgPJ7Ov_oBMUArD0chl2QonB3fSTs14eb8kVmGUhYsyMaO2AjEGhqh_N-1eUzJXD_v-_PNYLG4XrOT86hM6aMJVm88agWJuR10FoiSoq3T4-xZ0mDv1vPkAz6A/qLRW5QY3hSjl6s80amlaSqeBTox6rU8pF8XqtPS6LPQ),IMG-5155.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/SjN081NZ4XDML7mGbB7Byw/1V7ZZ2g3UdrLEBPEoe9X2Svp425pX_91OkJJFjAG09LCtnPMGhe1aakCK0bvoOdHulQR7xVYz0Ac6XvntFPArQKq_ioMxRxOfeZCA33QTqLWbVyNzLxtiRgh1jYS-I5GzAnHHQc7aYoAeANcK7Q_gQ/ao-o0X3VLFmOVNE7JzF7WDZ3OdI3WKRC2oTJIVfmj14)",Photos from school trips and interesting city locations from the program,"Sustainability, Health, Urban, Emerging Media",GLASS Newsletter,"Argentina, Buenos Aires Province, Buenos Aiires(CABA)",Yes,Fall/ Winter Senior
Water Quality Monitoring Training,Leadership Development,"Research/Lab Work,Volunteer Event/Experience,Special Course","In this workshop, a group of local volunteers and residents were taught proper procedure for collecting samples of river water and recording ambient and surrounding conditions and information. The Bronx River Alliance ecologists that hosted this training intend to use this volunteer network to maintain a flow of information on the Bronx River's water quality for internal use, advocacy, as well as reporting to local authorities and councilmembers.","The workshop helps with Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6) by teaching the right way to collect water samples, which is an important  skill for collective an independt water quality monitoring for communities which either rely on rivers for drinking or recreational purposes. Also, it's connected to Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11) because it encourages local people to get involved in looking after the environment in their area, making them feel responsible for keeping the city sustainable. The workshop is about Life Below Water (Goal 14) because it looks at how healthy the Bronx River is, which is really important for saving aquatic life and nature in the river. And it supports Good Health and Well-being (Goal 3) by making people aware of how the environment, river runoff, and local pollutants affects our local rivers and health if exposed to these contaminants, then empowering them to do things that make the environment healthier. Checking water quality is important for public health too, as it helps spot risks and stop diseases spreading, which keeps communities near the Bronx River safe.","
Although I wasn't able to be present during the summer collection season, participating in this workshop on water sampling and monitoring had a meaningful impact on personal development as an urban planner and environmentalist. From a professional standpoint, the workshop equipped me with valuable insights and skills in water quality monitoring, data collection, and analysis. These skills are directly applicable to my work as an urban planner, especially in designing and implementing sustainable water management strategies for communities that rely on rivers for drinking and recreational purposes. The ability to conduct independent water quality monitoring not only ensures the safety of water sources but also empowers communities to advocate for cleaner and healthier environments. Seeing how this is utilized will definitely follow me in my career and rest well in my environmental toolkit. Additionally, I met and got the contacts of a UN water systems specialist and a Michigan clean water activist who came to participate in the event and made good impressions with both of them. On a personal level, the workshop has deepened my commitment to environmental stewardship and community engagement. By fostering a sense of responsibility for the health of our local rivers and ecosystems, the workshop has motivated me to take proactive steps towards volunteering more in water quality and conservation projects in the future.",3/21/2023,3/21/2023,https://bronxriver.org/about,30750.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/hsePLdP1PbxWE7Qk33ye7A/CCHEu0aJ89rocA-iHp_8y2FlsNTcHB0l-hV9FT-RmpTg65delmC6riciQ3uifgMNoQgGY3D5srPpBldST50M_XiGwwlSuxpQIKQT49DP2xG9-iV9t9b0sfLwSzJ_An3atzSCbsBkujA3LIwnadBMwA/k2bU3pAumcsuiLgrhOgLFcbB3kB34JLD3RoskTolSm4),Demonstration of water sampling as group watches,,"I found out about this opportunity through the Bronx River Alliance newsletter that I subscribe to, they frequently post calls for volunteering, training, and community events.","Starlight Park-United States, NY, Bronx",No,Spring/Summer Junior
ICESDA Conference,Global Competency,Conference,"I traveled to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana in order to attend the first annual International Conference on Environment, Social, Governance and Sustainable Development of Africa hosted by Ghanian professors and public servants working in infrastructure and social development.","This conference was completetly centered around the UN SDGs and how they could be applied to African contexts and issues most effectively. This was emphasized by the Adinkrazation of the SDGS which is the transferring of the SDGs into Ashanti Adinkra symblogy and conceptualization to more effectively contextualize and internalize the goals for Ghanian and broader African contexts. The conference had a host of presentations ranging all SDG topics and especially had a lot of representation from people working on making communities more sustainable through renewable+clean energy, climate justice, infrastructure improvements, and reduced inequalities. Even quality education and gender equality were big touchstones for the conference, with many intersections between these and the successful implementation of every other goal.","As my first completely solo international journey, this was an amazing trip to have undertaken. Additionally, it being my first experience in Africa was very surreal. As a Black American, it was really meaningful to finally build tangible experiences, memories, and community in a continent that I've grown up being taught an ancestral reverance and connection to, however, I haven't been able to reach and connect deeply with West Africa. I'm really happy I not only made a bevy of professional connections with professors in urban planning, sustainable design, and infrastructural development, but also many students my age studying engineering, architecture, urban development, etc that will be assuming roles of leadership of their communities and nation in the future helping to push towards a brighter and more sustainable future.

As both a sustainability intern and engagement associate for the non-profit, I operate in many disciplines on this multi-faceted mission. I assist our solar hosting capacity study with DC planning, sustainability, data analysis, and land-use knowledge. I use my background in community-engaged research and hometown knowledge, sensibility, and sociabilities to engage residents on clean electrification by creating surveys, events, and educational media to prime the community for decarbonization.","In my role, I helped organize the largest consumer-facing home electrification event in the country, which is dedicated to educating homeowners, renters, home renovation professionals, and career seekers about the technologies, products, services, and incentives available for decarbonizing our homes. By promoting the adoption of solar energy and encouraging the use of energy-efficient appliances, my work directly supports UN SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). I also contribute to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by educating the public and professionals on how to make our urban environments more sustainable through improved energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in residential buildings. Furthermore, my focus on phasing out the use of fossil fuels in homes aligns with SDG 13 (Climate Action), as I aid in combating climate change by implementing actions that lower carbon emissions and increase public awareness of climate impact solutions.","Professionally, this internship offers me a substantial first step into public service and sustainability within Washington DC. It equips me with practical skills in major event planning and coalition building, both crucial in my future career in urban planning focused on sustainable development.

Student Workers at NYU Co-Founder and Core Organizer,Leadership Development,"Student Activity/Event/Club,Other,Employment/Job","Student Workers at NYU is a burgeoning undergraduate student worker union that is on track to unionize the RAs across NYU as early as Fall 2024. SWAN's roots draw back to Late Summer/Fall 2022, and as of Spring 2024, we have reached +72% support for our first contingent of workers we are unionizing, being the RAs within our reslife campaign. Student Workers at NYU is intended to be a wall to wall union that can connect the experiences and labor standards of undergraduate workers, give  a legally binding mechanism to bargain for fair working conditions, and improved worker protections and benefits. SWAN is a first-of-its-kind union at NYU, I'm proud to have joined the mission as one of the first 4 members and to be a core leader for the movement.","Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8): This goal promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. By striving to unionize, SWAN seeks to ensure fair labor practices and equal pay for undergraduate workers, which is a fundamental aspect of achieving decent work conditions. Unionization can lead to improved job security, better wages, and safer working environments, all of which contribute to economic growth by enhancing worker productivity and satisfaction. 

Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10): The efforts of SWAN can help reduce inequalities within the academic workforce by ensuring that undergraduate workers, who might otherwise be marginalized in labor negotiations, have a voice. By advocating for equal treatment and opportunities for student workers, SWAN helps level the playing field and ensures that these workers are not exploited due to their relatively lower power and status in the university hierarchy. 

Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): SWAN’s effort to unionize and create a sustainable working model for student workers exemplifies the importance of partnerships in achieving the SDGs. By collaborating with university administration, other labor organizations, and stakeholders within the university, SWAN can create a framework that can be replicated in other universities, thereby spreading the benefits of fair labor practices in academic settings.","Forming this union for RAs was one of the most important personal goals I had in terms of leaving a legacy at NYU. Getting the ball rolling, setting the groundwork for a very winnable union election, and pushing towards a much more sustainable, empowered, and just working environment for RAs, and hopefully all undergraduate workers at NYU over time, would be an amazing feat. I think this organizing campaign has exposed a lot of my leadership style qualities and weaknesses. I'm very great at leveraging connections, building trust, advertising, and having 1-1 conversations to get people on board. But I have a lot of growing to do when it comes to project management, consistency and meeting deadlines, taking initiative at low points and applying pressure on our goals. It's been challenging at many points, and I've wanted to give up on myself at many times. But I'm really glad I had faith in my team and my self, now we're on our way to accomplishing some great stuff.

By the end of the event, my team achieved second place with a design focusing on bio-mimicry.","- This event connects to two UN Sustainable Development Goals, mainly the focus on industry, innovation, and infrastructure, as well as sustainable cities and communities. A large focus of this event is finding ways to keep the data centers cost efficient and secure while also making it sustainable in the community it resides in. Furthermore, data centers are constantly expanding in scope and size, so creating efficient and sustainable data centers is more important than ever. This also leads to increased amounts of poolution, which this competition is aiming to reduce.","This event was my first real foray into a more proffesional working experience, and as a result, it influenced my professional goals. I am more interested in interships and research, and would like to prusue one next semester. It also introduced me to the world of data centers and storage, which I find interesting.

90 Day Korean Course,Global Competency,Special Course,"This course is a 3 month long, online course that teaches conversational and basic Korean for beginners. I have already completed a portion of this course, and plan on completely finishing it prior to my study abroad in Korea.","This activity connects to the 17th UN Sustainability Goal, which is ""Partnership for the Goals"".  What that goal represents is global communication and connections that focus on conquering the sustainabilty goals together. This is reflected in the course since it's primary usage is to communicate with my peers in Korea. This also allows me to focus on more research and extacurriculars in Korea, which are taught in Korea, hence following the concept of a partnership.","This course is helpful in many aspects of my life going forward, since learning a new language is vastly helpful in numerous scenarios. The most important aspect of learning a new language, at least for me, is that it allows me to work on research and extracurriculars in KAIST, which is part of proffesional development.

While studying at KAIST, I focused on taking courses that introduced me to different fields of computer science that I was interested in.","This component is most directly related to the UN Sustainable Goal 17, which is ""Partnership for the Goals"". Ultimately, my time at KAIST is a chance for me to learn about engineering through the perspective of a Korean institution, and in the future there will be more exchanges between the two schools that will help me expand on what I learned this semester. Furthermore, this component also relates to different grand challenges focusing on cubersecurity and virtual reality, both of which I was introduced to this semester. There was also a focus on UN Goal 9, which was ""Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure"" since that was a major point of focus for KAIST professors, or more specifically, how can I use what I learned to further the industries of my choosing.","This semester had a large impact on my academic goals moving forward since it helped solidify what I want to learn and focus on moving forward. Prior to this semester, I was only taking general courses in my major, but now I would like to focus on computer vision, computer networking, and artificial intelligence.

Forte Greene Volunteer Work,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,The main volunteer events that I attended had involved cleaning up the park from the leafs that had fallen from autumn in order to clear up the pathways for people but also by using huge tarps and bringing htem to a specific area in the park and in the second event it was big brown bags. Both were used to then be taken. The staff explained that they take the leafs to a recycling center in order to make leaf compost. Another volunteer event I did at Forte Green had involved volunteer work at the park which was for their tree lightning ceremony I was able to help set up and at my tabel I was able to help chirdren write letters to santa and direct parents to other booths for their kids. ,This experience can connect to one of the UN sutainable Development Goals called Sustaiable Cities and Communities because the volunteer work that was being done at the park elps contirbute to the sustainablity of the community of Brooklyn because not only do these event bring people together but everyone is helping to clean up the park and help make it easier for when stuff is taking to a recycling center to be made into new compost for the park. ,"This experience had an impact on my personal development by allowing me to a part of my community and getting to know more people. This also let me step out of my comfort zone by trying new things on my own, and communicating with people of all ages whether they were older, younger, or the same age as me, I was able to converse with them.

NYU MakerSpace Events ,Professional Development,Student Activity/Event/Club,"Majority of the events that I attended at the makerspace invovled creativity events. Mostly about how to do create things using certain machines in the Makerspace. There was one spcecific event that was about creating solar power with Solar Energy. The workshop broke down many aspects such as what is renewable energy, why renewable energy is important and much more.  ","Some connections I can make from the makerspace events to the UN Sustanainable Development would be Goal 7 and Goal 11. Goal 7 involves Affordable and Clean Energy, this relates to the event about solar energy because it is important to find new ways to use renewable energy to help protect the enivronment from climatye change, temperature rises and even human health. Goal 11 which is about sustainable cities and communities because being able to find new ways to use renewable energy is important to help the environmennt as a whole even if these steps are small.

NYU Florence Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,This component gave us an opportunity to get out of our comfort zones and be able to learn how to adapt to a new country while be able to immerse ourselves in a new culture. This experience has helped us not only immerse but be able to appreciate a new country. This also helps to be able to understand a new perspective for our research. ,"This experience connects to Goal 11 in the UN Sustainable Development which is to make Cities and humans settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. One of the concerns in this Goal is the amount of growing solid waste that is hapepning in gorwing cities, during my time at NYU Florence I feel that Italy has tried to tackle this problem. The way they did this was by always keeping their streets clean and they have very strict rules on garbage disposoals. You have sort your garbage a specific way if not the garbage trucks will not accept your trash or you can be fined. I feel that this is essential as to how Italy has been kept clean and how they are able to deal with waste. However this Goal also focuses on pollution and while Italy is kept really clean their air quality was always poor. This is an important matter that can be focused on in Italy, ","This experience has impacted my professional and academic goals. I enjoyed being able to take courses that were not just electives but also related to my major because I was able to obseerve how different the teaching style is for professors. I noticed that in Italy for my marketing class it was more team related but also with less work to be able to focus on our one project throughout the semester. I feel that the classes were much smaller than Tandon, so you are able to connect with the professors throughout the semester. This has also helped me professionally because it has helped me develop skills of adaptability, resilience, and being able to work with people of different cultures.

Korea University Exchange Program,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"Lived in Seoul. South Korea for a semester, and studied and took coursework at Korea University. Immersed myself in Korean culture, improved my Korean, met new people, and travelled a lot around South Korea.","The UN Sustainable Development Goal, ""Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"" has been very relevant to my experience in South Korea. I feel that South Korea as a nation is a prime example of success in this Sustainable Development Goal. When it comes to industry and innovation, South Korea's economic growth since the Korean War has been extremely rapid and I can see in my everyday life here how technologically advanced it is. When it comes to infrastructure, I can tell that Seoul has paid a lot more attention to its infrastructure than New York has in recent years. The subways are a clear example of this. There are glass barriers to prevent people from falling to the tracks, and it is kept well-cleaned and maintained.","I would say that my study abroad experience has definitely impacted my personal development the most. I pretty much grew up and went to college in the same place, and I never traveled much, so for me, adapting to a new country with a different culture and a language I didn't know by myself was a big challenge. However eventually, I did adapt and learn to live here despite not being completely fluent in the language. I definitely feel like this experience helped me become more adaptable to uncomfortable and foreign situations, and face them head-on.

Study Abroad in Denmark,Global Competency,Study Abroad,During spring 2023 I studied abroad in Denmark at Denmark Technical University. I lived on campus and studied from the end of January to the end of May 2023.,This is connected to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of quality education as I was able to experience education in another environment. Through studying at DTU I was able to learn through 4 hour classes and have very few assignments. Instead each class had a large exam at the end of the course where you were able to use all aids except for the internet. This was very different from what I was used to as in NYU assignments are necesary for most classes. Through this I was able to appreciate how education can be delivered in different forms but still be effective.,The impact of being able to stay in another country for months is massive. I was able to experience a culture vastly different from my own and this allowed me to look at my life from a different perspective. I learned to appreciate the slower pace of European life and took time for myself and various trips. I also spent a considerable amount of time with new friends who taught me about different cultures across Europe. As a result I was able to look at my own ideas and reevaluate why I agree or disagree with them.

Kodely Leader,Leadership Development,Employment/Job,This semester I worked for Kodely and taught coding and innovation courses as an afterschool activity for k-12 graders at two different schools in NYC and various Girl Scout Troops online. I taught the students how to program Micro:Bits and create new projects each week on them. I assisted in the creation of lesson materials and provided feedback on the lessons each week. ,"My experience with Kodely relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of quality education and the Grand Challenge of personalized learning. My goal was to make the lessons as interactive as possible because these students were coming out of a remote learning/hybrid environment. With younger students, I tried to do more activities involving movement to help them concentrate and release some energy. I also played videos and had them act out the code through games to help them understand it better. To make the learning experience more personalized I often changed the lesson plan based on prior classes or the mood of the room. The Girl Scout sessions were all taught online which was really hard to gauge the attention of the students. I noticed that some students had a hard time navigating their laptops, had issues with wifi, or were just not attentive at all. To help alleviate the technical issues I would stay after the lesson time to walk students who had issues through the lesson and provide my contact information and resources to help them through those issues. I also had a student who did not speak English, so I tried to translate some of the basic words of the lesson for them and simplify the technical language so they could understand. ","I have always been interested in how we can get more students engaged with STEM learning at a younger age. I think that taking up this opportunity has helped me understand how STEM learning can be incorporated at a younger age to help develop crucial problem-solving and thinking skills in students. I also had to learn to be flexible and adaptable. Oftentimes I had to change the activities right in the middle of the lesson when I saw that students weren't as engaged with the material.  My goal is to make programs like these more accessible to kids of all different backgrounds. With this foundational knowledge and teaching skills that I learned, I hope to volunteer at different programs in the future teaching underrepresented students. Through this experience, I even gained enjoyment from teaching that I never thought I would get. It has made me realize that I would like to continue to teach students maybe as a volunteer opportunity in the future.

I participate in weekly meetings, have done data analysis on a survey created, and have done lots of research regarding self-efficacy and first-year engineering education. ","Similar to my other GLASS component for this semester, this VIP relates to UN Sustainable Development Goal of quality education and the Grand Challenge of personalized learning. This semester was the first one for the VIP so we focused on research, data collection, and analysis. We were looking for the pre and post-survey result changes of self-efficacy in first-year engineering education students' capabilities. To assist in students gaining these skills to improve self-efficacy, we provided students with various handouts to guide them through their semester-long design project. The goal for the handout was to help students consolidate their ideas and look at each of their projects from a holistic view. In the future, we hope to implement our findings from the research to improve the quality of students learning in first-year engineering courses.  ",The work we did in this VIP is something that I have been very interested in and it also relates to my other component for this semester. I wanted to join the VIP because I really enjoyed my time in EG-1003 and wanted to see how we can improve courses like this for students to have a more meaningful learning experience. I also wanted to see how we can include practices from EG-1003 into other courses to make the learnings from courses more applicable to real-life projects instead of so heavily exam based. My favorite part of being in the VIP was doing the data analysis for the survey results. I was able to work with my fellow GLASS member Paige on cleaning data and conducting t-tests.

ACCESS Research Assistant - IoT Environment Station,Academic Excellence,"Research/Lab Work,Employment/Job","I worked for the Arabian Center for Climate and Environmental ScienceS (ACCESS) research center under Professor Francesco Paparella. During this time, I programmed, experimented, and researched methods to create a weather station using a Raspberry Pi.","This relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Climate Action because the work that we are doing is to get accurate data on climate change. The individual ""weather station"" that I am working on is a serioes of sensors that will be used with other stations to monitor weather and climate in various areas, specifically those areas that aren't monitered well like deserts. This data will then be free to access publically by people to make it more accessible than current data. This is the cornerstone to creating actionable climate change prevention meausres and is helping improve education and awareness regarding climate change. This also relates to Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The materials we are using to create these stations are relatively cheaper materials compared to those currently used at a large scale. This will allow communities all across the world to have access to make these stations and contribute to the data collection being done. Additionally, all of our code, wiring schematics, and processes to make the stations are open for anyone to see online.","I have never really wanted a career in Computer Science. Initially, I wasn't enjoying the work because we were all just sitting around a giant screen programming. I realized that I really like working with electrical components and doing hands on work. I didn't even make the realization that I enjoyed the work that much until a few of the other undergraduates in the lab told me that I am having way too much fun with this. My lab mentor even mentioned that I am really good with electronics and soldering and gave me all the tasks that had to do with that.

The lessons I learned in class were directly applicable to my work life, enabling me to become a more effective and supportive team member. Additionally, the speakers provided invaluable networking opportunities, sharing their career journeys and inspiring me with their achievements. One speaker in particular, Stacie Grossman Bloom, the Chief Research Officer, Vice Provost & Vice Chancellor for Global Research and Innovation at NYU, left a lasting impact on me. Her vulnerability and story of pursuing her passions despite risks encouraged me to embrace uncertainty in my own journey and take the time to discover and follow my true passions. I was also able to meet other like minded students at NYU, outside of my usual Tandon community, to see how I can get involved on campus.

Self Planned Service Event: Letter Writing to Elders,"Leadership Development, Commitment to Service","Volunteer Event/Experience,Student Activity/Event/Club","My fellow GLASS scholar Raiya Haque and I planned a service event for all Brooklyn Halls residents at NYU. We planned, advertised, and executed and event to write letter for the organization Love For Our Elders. ","This experience relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goals of Good Health and Well-Being and Reduced Inequalities. The outcome of the event promotes mental health and emotional well-being for elderly individuals. Social isolation greatly impacts the health of elderly, being association to higher risk of health problems such as heart disease, depression, and cognitive decline all which can lead to a person’s increased risk of premature death. By writing these letters we hoped to reduce the feelings of isolation for the recipients of the letters and bring smiles to their faces. Reduced Inequalities relates to the goal of fostering intergenerational connections between younger and older adults who are often marginalized an ignored in communities. ","I used to view service as a large scale event that needs high turn out and physical labor, like a park clean up or volunteering at a shelter. It made me think about the inaccessibility of these community service activities. Wanting to support the aging community, Raiya and I aimed to create an event that demonstrated how easy and accessible giving back can be. Through organizing this letter-writing event, I discovered that service doesn’t have to be daunting and can be more inclusive for everyone. This experience provided me with a long-term way to stay involved in the community, and I was able to inspire some participants to continue letter writing, as it required minimal effort yet had a meaningful impact. This event also helped me interact with more members of my cohort that I hadn’t interacted with before! I am planning on doing this event again this year and hope to involve more GLASS scholars.

NYU Shanghai Study Away,Global Competency,Study Abroad,I studied away at NYU Shanghai during 2023 Spring. Shanghai is one of the largest cities China as a financial center. ,"The study away experience is related to Quality Education and Partnership for the Goals of UN Sustainable Development Goals. Studying in another country may bring up the quality of one's education, although not everyone is provided with the opportunity. It connects students’ original locations with their study abroad destinations not only geographically but also culturally. For example, my study away experience in Shanghai made me think from local people's perspectives and helped me realize how other countries put effort in the UN Sustainable Development goals. ","During my study away semester at NYU Shanghai, I took several courses from the IMA (Interactive Media Arts) department and a social science class with an emphasis on ethnographic thinking. On the one hand, I have further developed my design skills in communication via shape and color, typography, sound, photography, post-production, etc. On the other hand, the social science class has made me rethink design, engineering, and even the world from anthropological perspectives. Therefore, I may not pursue a pure design career in the future but something mixed with design and anthropology, such as digital marketing with anthropological thinking.

UMASS Undergraduate Researcher,Academic Excellence,"Research/Lab Work,Internship,Employment/Job",My research with Prof Marianna was done in collaboration with NASA Glenn and with the Airforce. In a group of 12 Graduate students I was the only freshman in the entirety of the session. I worked on composites under process modeling and the goal was to predict the effects before its process modeling stage.,"The UN goal that mostly correlates with my summer research would be innovation and infrastructure as my team in particular was put in charge in developing a framework regarding process modeling. The goal was to use FEA (Finite element Analysis) to predict thermal and chemical properties before it was even subjected to any process modeling at all, while using the large data set we were given. All to create an infrastructure for future desired mixture tests. This would allow researches to quickly guage the effectiveness of a mixture ratio based off its material and matrix-to-fiber ratio.","This was the first time I was able to be comfortable in just pursuing anything. The email that was sent out to the seniors was not meant for me but I didnt care.

I made sure If I got reected it was because of something that was beyond me, I was not giving up. For the first time I grew as a person and this experience showed me a lot before I even started my first day. Additionally, it did not stop there, I had to work harder than my fellow peers who were already graduates to catch-up and understand all the vocabulary that was being said in the meetings and a lot of reading was done during this summer and a lot of sleep-less nights were made. I would argue I worked harder this summer than I have ever worked on any semester in highschool or college as of now. Although, officially my final day of work was August 26, it did not stop there as my partners were all chosen for a PhD with my professor.

My Study Abroad Experience : Denmark (DTU),Global Competency,Study Abroad,"This component was a study aborad experience to Europe specifically Coppengaen, Denmark. I studied at DTU which is a fantastic engieneering school that has amazing focsuses in Aerospace specifically in sustainable windmills which is what they are most known for.","Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11): DTU is located in Denmark, a country known for its sustainable urban development and as alluded to specifically on their world renowned engineering in windmills. By studying in Denmark, you can learn about innovative approaches to urban planning, renewable energy, and sustainable architecture. This knowledge can help you contribute to creating sustainable/Green cities 

Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9): DTU is ahead in technological advancements and research. By studying there, you have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge research projects and innovative solutions to global challenges. This aligns with SDG 9, which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote industrialization, and foster innovation.

Quality Education (SDG 4): By studying at DTU, you are pursuing higher education and contributing to the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education. DTU is renowned for its academic excellence and research in engineering and technology as highlighted by their world ranking in Engineering.","Studying abroad at DTU in Denmark has been an incredible experience that has not only shaped my understanding of the world but has also taught me valuable lessons about myself. Initially, my decision to study at DTU was rather spontaneous. Originally, I had planned to go to Italy, but prior to that, I had dreamt and really wanted Germany. Therefore, when the opportunity to study in Denmark unexpectedly presented itself, I made the decision at the last minute.

 DTU offered an enriching academic experience that differed from the traditional semester at NYU. Although it was a unique experience, it enabled me to acquire valuable skills. Collaborating with students from various backgrounds allowed me to refine my social skills in a more diverse setting. The emphasis on project-based learning at DTU sharpened my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, working alongside others exposed me to different approaches in tackling problems. For instance (simple example), during my initial weeks, I was introduced to Overleaf, which proved to be a game changer when it came to writing reports.

 My time abroad has had a profound impact on my professional plans and overall outlook. Taking part in a PhD-level class as a sophomore was a challenging and intense experience. If I had the opportunity to do it over, I might reconsider, as it consumed a significant portion of my time. However, being a part of this class provided valuable insights into my future academic pursuits. While I previously never questioned my path in academia and would have pursued it blindly, the discussions with my peers shed light on the realities of that path and whether or not I will take this path is still on the table.

 As I look ahead, I anticipate cherishing the small moments I shared with the people I met during my time in Denmark, both those I got to know well and those I didn't. The shared adventures, cultural exchanges, and late-night phone calls will forever be etched in my memory. In a year, I believe I will occasionally reminisce about the times I chose to study or be alone instead of hanging out. I believe I could have experienced Denmark more fully, but considering my personal circumstances, I feel content with what I was able to achieve.",1/18/2023,5/20/2023,"https://personal-project-glass-project.italoperalta.repl.co

LA Hacks Hackathon Mentoring,Leadership Development,"Volunteer Event/Experience,Student Activity/Event/Club,Special Course",I voluntered at one of biggest hackathons (over 400 participants) in the West Coast in order to help middle and high school students create solutions to solve problems that pertain to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Engineering Grand Challenges. I also took part in a special workshop learning how to use Niantic 8th Wall to create realistic AR/VR experiences viewable from your desktop and phone.  ,"One of the tracks of LA Hacks that hackers could create solutions for was the Green House track. This track focused on the importance of the environment on homebuilding and creating projects that could produce sustainable solutions that could protect natural homes for years to come. Another track was the ""Operation Safe and Sound"" track that focused on building projects that improved the privacy and security in the doings of our everyday lives. 

These tracks relate to Goals 4 and 6 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. By providing mentorship to these high school students, I am providing my knowledge and expertise of machine learning and deep learning to students who would have to consult outside tutorials and YouTube videos to learn it without specialized help. I am therefore providing quality education to these students. Furthermore, since Track 2 of the event corresponds to an environmental challenge, I am encouraging these high school students to create ways to produce clean water and sanitation for their homes and to reduce contamination for proper nutrition in all Bay Area neighborhoods.","I have mostly lived within the NYC area so getting to experience the Bay Area was a nice treat. Different problems plague different areas and I got to experience the more car-centric ways of the Bay Area, which got me thinking of some urban solutions.

Different languages have different words that cannot be translated into English (or they are translated into seemingly obsolete or SAT words that no one knows) and being able to know those words helps to make conversation more natural with the natives rather than having a run-on-sentence in English.

Study Abroad In Sweden,Global Competency,Study Abroad,I completed the required study abroad semester for GLASS in Lund University during the fall 2023 semester. ,"Lund University and the country of Sweden are heavily focused on companies and schools working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. For example, the design center in the school contains all of the goals laid out as blocks throughout the building as an attraction and the INTN01 Innovation Management course I took focused on two of the UN goals specifically to follow for the team projects. 

""To narrow it down, we would like to focus on three of the goals: how might achieve good
health and well-being (#3), how might we achieve sustainable cities and
communities (#11), and how might we ensure sustainable consumption and
production (#12). Health and well-being covers a wide range of issues such
maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases and epidemics, obesity,
access to health care and vaccines, sexual and reproductive health, substance
abuse, and mental health and well-being""  ","Studying abroad in Sweden was a phenomenal experience and really helped me to see how studying in another country was like. I took part in so many different activities than the same old than I would normally take in NYU and it was changed what activities I might pursue in New York.

For example, I have an interest in becoming a member in the effective altruism cohort in NYC after spending sometime learning about AI Alignment in the effective altruism cohort in Lund and taking a trip to the annual meeting in Stockholm to learn more about the field in general. I now want to visit Berkeley because of professors there who have foundational roles in the field and for spending more time in Silicon Valley after not having enough time there mentoring during LA Hacks. 

I might also join a fraternity after having a positive experience having a position as head of IT / Web in Sydskånska Nation during my time in Sweden and taking part in many activities and parties with a group where I belong and with good friends.

AI Alignment Course - EA Lund,Academic Excellence,"Student Activity/Event/Club,Special Program",I took an AI Alignment course in collaboration with AI Safety North and EA (Effective Altruism) Lund in order to learn more about the effective altruism movement and to learn about the up and coming field of AI Alignment. ,This connects to UN Goal Number 9 of the UN Development Goals since controlling for proper AI Alignment can prevent the stereotypical fear of AI taking over the world and can help lead to new ways to prototype infastructure with 3D holographic visualizations and completion of template code for simple CAD tasks. We can also reduce biases from AI Alignment by checking that the AI fits our human ideas instead of amplifying stereotypes as assigned by UN Goal Number 10.,"I had never really considered doing something in effective altruism before coming to Lund. I was always quite skeptical of charities. However, attending the effective altruism chapter in Lund helped me find new people that elucidated the field for me and made it clearer how to best donate for good and how to clearly do research on AI Alignment schemes for understanding the latest in the field.

NYU Study Abroad Digital Twin Sustainable Development in Vietnam,"Leadership Development, Global Competency, Professional Development","Special Course,Study Abroad","In this experience, I went to the campus of VinUniversity in Hanoi, Vietnam to do the Digital Twin To Tackle Sustainable Development in Smart Cities in Hanoi program with Tandon Global in order to find out how to reduce congestion and pollution in a city with one of the worst air pollution levels in the world.** I learned how to use the GAMA platform to simulate traffic levels around the Hoam Kiem Lake complex and see where congestion really forms.","This experience connects to the UN Sustainable Development Goals because it directly relates to Goal 3 and Goal 11. Goal 11 is directly related to the core of the program since we were focused on improving the public transportation around the Hoam Kiem Lake complex. According to the goal, only one in two urban residents have convienent access to public transportation and resort to filthier options including riding gas powered motorcycles or owning their own car. Our team proposed building bus lanes and creating new bus routes to convince the people of Hanoi to switch from their motorcycles to the public bus system or converting to ride electric bikes. Health is an important goal we targeted too as well since pollution can cause adverse health effects if one is exposed to it in high levels - an unhealthy AQI can lead to trouble breathing and increased likelihood of lung cancer. Cleaner atmospheres lead to longer lives!","I never thought I would ever have a chance of going to Vietnam prior to this study abroad experience. This has allowed me to understand the atmosphere and the challenges that Southeast Asia brings to solving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ranging from the collectivism mindset (associating yourself with a community to raise social status) to the need to ride a motorcycle since it can take you anywhere and everywhere compared to the strict routing of a bus. How do you understand why Vietnam is one of the top most polluted countries without realizing why it is so? It also defies expectations as the only thing that Americans know about Vietnam is about the Vietnam War and the Vietcong.

I was in charge of developing a chatbot to allow the user to get a brief summary of the results from the dashboard on the front-end.","This work can attribute to the NAE Grand Challenge of advancing health informatics. While this startup is mostly focused on companies that may use lots of tools to optimize and keep track of their performance of pull requests, task completion and updates via GitLab, Trello or GitHub, the same can be done for any healthtech startup that aims to understand a patient’s condition by monitoring toxicology reports, heart rate levels and nutrient and mineral levels to ensure a patient stays in good health. Having such a dynamic dashboard would allow hospital workers to always stay in tip-top shape regarding answering questions about a patient’s condition and allow them to prescribe the correct medication during and after treatment.","This experience had quite an impact on my professional development because it allowed me to explore learning about how to prompt LLMs from provided context to allow them to spew out responses that aren’t generic and custom tailored to data they are provided.

I took part in undergraduate research, computer science and math coursework, and cultural trips. ","This realtes to UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communites because of the work I did in my research lab and the UAE's dedication to using reneable energy. I learned a lot about the implementation of sustainable technology not just the positive effects it has after it is used. Because the country has so much sunlight, I saw how they found creative ways to use it. They also have residence communites that are fully powered by renewable energy and are net zero emissions. ","The city inspired me to get creative about approaching sustainability. Rather than thinking of renewable energy as just solar farms and wind turbines, they can be incorporated into existing buildings and the natura enviornment. For instance, one of the first skyscrapers I saw in Abu Dhabi had a slanted roof that was angled to collect sunlight on the solar panels it had. Other buildings were built in ways to minimize sunlight from entering the glass windows so it would not get too hot during the summer, thus lowering energy costs.

Vietnam Short Term Course,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I took a short-term course at VinUniversity in Hanoi, Vietnam where I learned about how digital twins can be used for sustainable development. I was also able to go in cultural excursions where I learned about the history of the country and how people live.","This experience connects to UN SDGs 9, 11, and 13. I worked on using a digital twin model around a heavily tourist area with 2 other Tandon students and 2 Vietnamese undergrad students with the aim of reducing pollution. Our approach was to alter existing infrastracture to organize traffic to reduce congestion and therefore reduce pollution. This would result in better air quality and quality of life to local people.","My experience in Vietnam has significantly shaped my professional, academic, and personal development. Professionally, I contributed to a project in Vietnam using a digital twin model to reduce pollution in a heavily touristed area, directly supporting UN SDGs 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). This work aligned with my goal of applying technology for sustainable development. Academically, I deepened my expertise in infrastructure modeling and environmental engineering, building on my prior research in Abu Dhabi, where I also used digital twins to model sensor data and sustainable infrastructure. Personally, these experiences enhanced my cultural awareness and adaptability, as I navigated new environments and built strong connections with international teams.

Future Engineering Education VIP,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,"This was a research project focusing on determining the difference in self-efficacy of first year engineering students before and after completing a first year engineering course. We deisgned and chose certain activities for the students to compelte that we believed would impact self-efficacy and had students reflect on how these activities impacted their engineering confidence. The data, which was collected through surveys, was complied, organized, and determined significantly significant before being submitted to ASEE first as an abstract, then as a rough draft. The final paper will be submitted in Februrary 2023. ","I believe that this connects to the UN Sustainable Development goal of ensuring Quality Education. With the transition back into in-person learning, engineering education has severly suffered with a lack of hands-on experience in the engineering field. This research is measuring first year student's self-efficacy and determining how certain assignments improve confidence and decrease anxiety in engineering topics and skills. Additionally, in the future this report aims to connect back to minorities in the engineering field and see how self-efficacy compares and improves through a first year engineering cirriculum, connecting back to the UN's goal to create includive and equitable education. Overall, the work done in this VIP connects back to the UN""s goal to help alleviate the global learning crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and create inclusive education, through the use of hands-on learning and self-efficacy development through specific assignments and the future applications of this research to minorities in STEM.","I bleieve that this experience has really confirmed my interest in the engineering education field and has inspired me to think about how future engineers will be educated. I was already interested in how we could change engineering education prior to joining this research team, but I thinka fter seeing the data and thinking about the futher implications of the work we were doing, it confimred my interest even more and made me think of different things that I hadn't contributed to engineering education before. It gave me the chance to read some interesting articles about different first year programs and their effectiveness, and sparked my interest more in how we can make engineering more inclusive, increasing self-efficacy in underrepresented populations in engineering. Additionally, this VIP gave me an introduction to research and data science, skills that I believe will be very applicable in the future. Lastly, this research gave me the opportunity to gain my CITI certification for Social and Behavioral Research. Overall, I think that the work I did in this VIP gave me some technical skills surrounding research and data collection in addition to more information and outlooks surrounding my interest in engineering education and the ethics of engineering education.

Study Abroad at Politecnico di Milano,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I studied Chemical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy for the spring 2023 semester. I lived in university housing in Como, Italy and studied courses covering a wide range of topics (mainly focused around sustainability). I took the opportunity to take courses that aren't offered at Tandon by taking some CBE electives and ethics courses. I also became involved with an on-campus organization, where I participated in weekly cultural activities and monthly trips across Italy. ","Goal: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Through my time at Politecnico di Milano, I took a course titled ""Chemistry for Sustainable Polymers"" in which we learned about the range of plastics and bio-plastics available and their corresponding effects on the environment. Real world professionals attended as guest lecturers to talk about the recycling field and about the development of effective, sustainable materials. We zeroed in on the types of plastic waste that are present in high quantities (for example: rubber dust from shoes on pavement) and then discussed how these are effecting the environment and what sort of recycling techniques or sustainable polymers could be used to replace and diminish the plastic's effect. Overall, through this course I learned a lot about sustainable consumption of plastics and ways that we can ensure that the large amounts of plastic that are present in the environment are either 1. being recycling properly (i.e. effective separation, chemical vs mechanical recycling, etc.) and 2. being replaced with sustainable bio-polymers to continue to decrease their impact on the earth.

All of these activities mentioned above also align with the UN goal of improving life on earth, as these work towards improving both our aquatic and land ecosystems.","This was my first service based trip, and while the work we did was hard, through this program I gained a new global perspective while working towards my personal goals surrounding sustainability. I learned a lot about various sustainability practices happening globally and had the chance to transition my knowledge on these practices from theory to practice, by applying it in real world contexts. Facing hardships while on this program, I learned a lot about the socio economic status of parts of Sri Lanka, broadening my global perspective and further enhancing my global awareness. Overall, my work in Sri Lanka proved invaluable in expanding my world view while providing me with more knowledge and experience on sustainability practices that will influence my final deliverables within the GLASS program.

Working in the semiconductor industry and at a manufacturing site specifically, innovation and consistent manufacturing are at the forefront of company action. Additionally, my work within the R&D group aligns with the UN goal for Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. As a process engineer, I also helped work towards improving efficient production and reducing wastes, contributing to the UN goal of Responsible Consumption and Production.","This experience had a major impact on my professional goals. This co-op was my first exposure to industry and served as a launchpad for determining what type of work I would like to do post graduation.

Service to Our Elders,Commitment to Service,"Volunteer Event/Experience,Student Activity/Event/Club","This volunteering event was organized by fellow glass member Elizabeth, and I took part in the event of writing letters to the elderly. As a previous volunteer at a senior home in high school, I was familiar with how lonely elders could get and wanted to help them feel more connected to others and brighten up their days.

","The service of writing letters to the elderly through the company “Love for Our Elders” connects to the UN Sustainable Goal of Good Health and Wellbeing. This effort aims to enhance the mental and emotional state of seniors, potentially leading to increased happiness through personalized letters. The letters they receive are each written by diverse individuals who are sharing a variety of stories and creative thoughts, which brings a refreshing element to the seniors. By fostering this communication and connection, this initiative helps reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation among the elderly, contributing to their overall well-being.

","This experience allowed me to convey my thoughtfulness. I wrote a letter to a woman who loves crosswords and any type of games, so I made my letter a bit more fun for her by incorporating a crossword. I learned that little things like that can show how individuals understand each other. It improved my communication skills, teaching me how to convey empathy and kindness, which are qualities all individuals should have. Academically, it encouraged me to be more thoughtful and creative in my writing and allowed me to show someone that I understand and empathize with them.",2/24/2024,2/24/2024,,"b3f7dd3f-3dcd-4857-8f57-530ada2e55d5.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/Lw3vFalKkbXkRYitohJB9g/1bC-c5ZjJ9gl8CjkLcCOQc7YIhB1LSy87O2byz8SC1DENhs24PKOM5aJ9qPhRet0BwqZZvzwxn9jnfnUBQX1Jtkvbb0XwLXT1AVFI56MpQT7Hli7iVUUoVCoYaaQkiaS1w8UiP6NDg3ZhOO4ZqmWkVGlB5QctX6a6lhCyUGTq27VLM73jOQlDmRZw72HIIEiGdOO0bFPmWnRgSyLGBaqAw/e_zgKD1xl06L4IJYZ95oVw06xN8UjLhM02HbnuHaE5g),1cfb11e8-985c-4974-9d5e-3dc08483a8b0.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/bsVD_hTCDzLoX4QuJNJJyg/I9ip5eUubeQI0sWK8ePEMyryd5VFY10VNw0J1MP99XIQbSs9M2GQlxQRQVWbpNYN70qqmOnSHjS6WRzO5e_nKbI2mcsLX-iiOPVFKAGQJjmlHp-L0aTFB3S6AVTuWBYqWlcYWuAINWEYEYhpdB68StaHkHPKAjAEnjT26MLvTcLpqLAxyudnCeEomdQQgos7kS7op_hpafXLGc8jYPHqRw/78atIkY42OJWurtp48bHNCOInz63Z5-pP7z1m-_cVCc),80332075-29b7-4edd-b0ee-4805ae793449.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/9y0ilsaQwBhjR-4SUk074w/E9_IBL5z1vahm17gbbrasZOnkMzmYZcKvLDjwW5y-9rddr7Fd3vONOl_Xf66nSaTByD2kWWi_Go6h67f_IwJ2OqW-Ey8k5d6XCfD_atNWzLyf9PonE4FSfgkRA8XaXqcYZHfiv3CKrJnzFqNZ2BeL0oxmBLm0hoSgw77hQ5bLQa7rxRGZWYBJkxpIk3As2GxzDVvSKvsZx1J0u_hP6OXYA/eezVPXFvjRiMArUDzck1uGQNycJE2b5n5Z22Kxbfnj4)","

Backend Liaison for Augmented Library VIP,Leadership Development,Student Activity/Event/Club,"I have been part of the Augmented Library VIP for three semesters now, so as one of the more experienced members on the team, I was ready to take on a leadership role in the backend subteam and be a liaison between the multiple teams. As the liaison for the API/Databases team, I led the development of the calendar functionality team and was the main communicator with the other subteams.

","The Augmented Library VIP is focused on augmented reality, a strongly emerging form of media, which is also a Tandon Area of Research Excellence. This  approach enhances how students interact with educational resources. It connects to the UN Sustainable Goal of Quality Education because the goal of the augmented library app is to give students access to resources in Dibner, including study rooms, books, and other e-texts. By leveraging augmented reality, the app makes learning more interactive and accessible, fostering an enriched experience.

","This leadership experience taught me to be proactive and to be a good communicator in between groups. For this VIP, subteams are supposed to meet on their own time and work on the respective components of their project. Often times it was challenging to coordinate with the team and make sure that individuals were putting proper effort into this team. Coordinating this required clear communication to ensure alignment and progress toward our common goals as well as making sure that what separate teams were working on could come together as a complete project.

I was able to partake in a few different clubs such as the basketball team, the dance club, and a lab for research. I also made friends from all different years, countries, and academic areas. It was an overall amazing experience and really taught me a lot about other cultures. ",This experience connects to goal # 17: partnership for the goals which is centered around creating global partners to support each other towards accomplishing these goals. I was able to study abroad and understand how important globalization and taking other cultures into consideration in when trying to design a large-scale solution. ,"This experience left me with many amazing friends, mentors, and memories that will forever impact my personal and professional development. I have learned a lot about how culture can affect the way people interact and work and that it is important to learn about other cultures and the way they do this to be respectful.

Indonesia J-Term,Commitment to Service,Special Course,I went on a service/learning trip to Indonesia where I worked with the School of Business Management at the Insitute of Technology at Bandung to learn about sustainable farmign initiatives and how members of a rural village are attempting to maitain culture and teach children how to live healthy and sistainable lifestyles. I worked alongside SBM ITB and fellow NYU students to observe the organizations and provide detailed summaries and recomendation on how they can make their processes better. ,"This window connects to many UN sustainable development goals but the two main ones would be goals number 4 and 13. Goal number 4 is quality education and this experience worked to provide Indonesian children (both rural and urban) a quality educucation as well as providiing adults with proper education on how to take care of the planet. This brings me to Goal 13 which is climate action, as this experience had a heavy emphasis on focusing on sustainable and environment-friendly initiatives whether it was eco-tourism or recycling education. ","This taught me how different global cultures attack global issues such as climate change and showed me how different cultures approach the issues differently. It also showed me hod simple solutions can sometimes be, and that always focusing on modern and innovative technology as a means to solve an issue is neither sustainable nor necessary.

This position is one that I earned after working as a Peer Writing Tutor for a year and a half and building my skills as a mentor who is able to assist students on their analytics and reasoning.  ","This experience has taught me about language barriers since most of my students do not have a full grasp of the english language and therefore require additional help outside of the classroom. My GLASS project focuses on the goal of reduced inequalities, specifically geographically, in locations that might not have as many resources. These locations might also have a different native language, and thus understanding communication between languages and cultures is of the essence. Being a writing consultant and having only 45 minutes to fully understand and coach a student that might be a native speaker of a different language has taught me many important tips and skills that are relevant to my GLASS project.

This has allowed me to gain a greater understanding of how genetics effects the production and distribution of medicinal substances which will assist me in my progress in the health aspect of the Health aspect of the Tandon Areas of Excellence. I have gotten this far by allocating a specific time during the weekend for me to listen to and complete the tasks of the course.,"This course directly aligns with knowledge in the ""Engineer Better Medicines"" challenge of the Grand Engineering Challenges. Both the course and the challenge focus on the improvement of current day medicines through examining the genetic code of certain diseases. Furthermore the course also is involved in the challenge of ""Advancing Health Informatics""  as it speaks about updating  public health databases to improve the level and accuracy of information provided to a population. ",Part of my objective was to initally gain knowldege on the current advancements in the field of personalised medicine as well as to identify what current barriers are present to the current progress. Whilst doing the course I also learnt the specifcs of how specifc gene defects lead to disease as well as how they come about. Furthermore I believe I underwent academic progress as part of the course was about the specifcs of data collection and analysis in regards to genetics as well as improving online databases.

Teaching Assistant for General Engineering Department ,Commitment to Service,Employment/Job,"Throughout the semester I was  an EG TA where I taught the Lab and Open Lab Sections and was also a RAD mentor. The Labs consisted of teaching the students the basics of multiple forms of engineering and assisting them to perform experiments related to the form of engineering. The Open Lab consisted of helping students who were doing their semester long project and troubleshooting any issues. Being a RAD mentor meant guiding a forup of students through their semester long project by provifing guidance on the feasibility of their projects goals as well as helping them understand the resources and deadlines involved in their project.  
","This component relates most greatly towards the UN Sustainable Goal of ""Quality Education"". This is because being a Lab TA involved creating an inclusive environment which would create a positive and learning inducing attitude within the students. Also since the labs teach multiple fields of engineering, it provides students with a greater range of abilities and skills. It also relates to the ""Advance Personalised Learning"" Grand Challenge since, during the lab, different learnign methods had to be applied in order to ensure that the students had grapsed the materials. (Visual, auditory etc)","This experience impacted both my professional and personal goals. Being in the lab involved frequently presenting on various topics in a clear and concise manner to the students and my communication skills in the lab were improved as I had to clearly provide the instructions of the lab experiment. I believe these improved my professioal development goals as these skills would be useful in mulitple companies or startups. It was also personally developing as I improved my general confidence by being able to present consistently.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad ,Global Competency,Study Abroad,I compelted a semester study abroad at NYU Abu Dhabi. Here I was able to visit multiple cultural locations and hence learn about the history and culture of the country. I was also able to utlize the locations facilities for an undergraduate reaseach opportunity ,"One aspect of the Sustainability Goals that the Study abroad allowed me to view was the promotion of inclusive and equitable quality education. The teaching methods and style of the professor at NYUAD are vastly different. There is a greater focus on the actual understanding of the content, with the professors answering student questions more eagerly. Additionally, almost every class has its own respective recitation that provides questions based on the content for the week allowing for every student to understand the topics and actually gain a desire to learn throughout their life. It also therefore relates to the Personalized learning Grand Challenge as the student is free to question both in recitation and in office hours and their feedback on the course is taken into account .","In Abu Dhabi I was able to professionally grow since I was able to undergo an undergraduate student research where I was able to work on my own project. Due to the academic rigour of the location, I belive I imporved on my academic ability at least in terms of grasping content. I also learnt a greater deal on how to manage academic time with a social life. During this time I was also able to undergo a positive personal change, where I became more of a social individual due to increased interactions within campus.

Research Assistantship At NYUAD,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,I completed an undergraduate assistantship with professor Khalil Ramadi for the spring semester. During this time I initally was trained and worked on the freezing and cryosectioning of mice and rat organs that have been treated to miroscopically examining them. During the semester I was also trained and became proficient in machines such as the resin printer and tensile strength tester. I also was working on my own project which involved electrically stimulating the gut in order to treat neurological disorders.,"This connects to the Grand Challenge of Engineering better Medicines. Since the focus of my project is too utilize the gut to target neural disorders, this would allow individuals who have issues directly with their brains (past aneurysms, strokes, hemorrages), to be treated for the same disorders with a reduced risk. This would also allow for more of a persoanlized version of treatment as the current and duration can be adjusted according to the person. It also ties in to the Sustainable Goal of ensuring healthy lives. THis is because the treatment would ideally allow for a less intrusive curing of the individual and so encompasses a greater age range. ",This certainly had a positive impact on my professional goals. This is was due to me experiencing how a research workplace would be and how to navigate requesting different tasks from different specialists. It also gave me an idea on the kind of deadlines are placed on researchers (where they had to show decent progress through weekly updates). This consequently impacted my academic goal and viewpoint. Initally I had viewed getting a masters in science as a neccessity but am now considering either an MBA or  directly trying to form my own business.

Thus, designing websites that have useful information, don’t hoard resources (computational power and bandwidth), and can be accessed in many different devices is extremely important to ensure that such a valuable resource can be used by as many people as possible. For these reasons, this course closely relates to Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as the internet has become a vital part of modern infrastructure, and making well designed websites can elevate an individual’s or business’ ability to communicate and share information with the world. It is also applicable to Goal 4 (Quality Education), as well designed and inclusive internet can open the doors for many people to further their education and knowledge (just as this online course enabled me to learn something different and new).","This introductory course gave me a taste of web development and showed the challenges and accomplishments involved in making a website. Armed with this knowledge I have opened new pathways to further my learning, and now that I know the fundamentals, I can start delving deeper into more specific web development paradigms and frameworks. It was very enjoyable to learn more about a different field than the usual programming that I am used to, and learn how to make consumer-centric programs in the form of webpages. The course also allowed me to experiment with a toolset that is centered towards reak-world use, instead of being purely academic, so it was a nice change of pace from the usual experience of learning pure theory.",10/26/2022,11/8/2022,https://coursera.org/share/89a5fa859d4065ae61324a9327e6786a,,/,Communications/IT,I saw this course highlighted in Coursera's Computer Science course selection.,"Remote/Online Course, taken during Fall 2022 Semester in New York City, NY, USA.",Yes,Fall/Winter Sophomore
AI Summit NYC,Professional Development,Conference,"The AI Summit was a professional conference held in New York City where many individuals and organizations that are researching, deploying, or otherwise interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning gathered to share information and network. The AI Summit is a conference dedicated to showcasing the best in AI, highlighting the different ways it can be applied, and also connecting people and groups with an interest in the field, promoting further advancements. Other than the informative talks and exhibitions, the summit was a networking experience.","At the Summit I had the opportunity to learn more about Graphen Inc, a company that is actually working on mimicking the human brain using artificial intelligence. This goes hand in hand with the challenge of Reverse-Engineering the human brain, which is a topic that I have a deep interest in. Their goal in this project is to not only provide healthcare related advancements but also improvements in finance, security, and energy. I also had the opportunity to check out Deloitte’s stand, where they have projects integrating AI with VR and AR to advance business, which is closely related to the grand challenge of enhancing virtual reality. The whole event was full of companies and people that are using AI for many different purposes, and it was great to see how a single technology can bring progress in a variety of fields, and get us closer to solving the challenges that we face as a society.","Attending the conference was a very valuable experience for me as it was the first time I ever went to a professional conference. As I expect to be going to many conferences in the future when I become a fully fledged professional, it was nice to get a “first contact” with something that will become a part of my life later on. I got to meet many professionals and representatives from different companies. Making connections with people in a cutting edge industry that is only expected to grow more will certainly prove helpful, particularly when it comes to career opportunities.

Study Abroad at Korea University,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I spent a semester abroad in Seoul, South Korea, studying at Korea University. Other than taking required classes for my major I had the opportunity to learn the Korean language and get to visit Korea (and Asia) for the first time. ","Relates to goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. South Korea has come so far in so little time. As the de facto Asian Tiger, South Korea has shown the world that with dedication and organization, it is possible to take a war-torn country from the bottom to the top of the food chain. This ambition and determination is present in Seoul as a whole, but especially in Korea University, where my peers, both Korean and from elsewhere have shown exemplary dedication and inspired me to push ever forward in pursuit of my career growth. The networking experiences have also been incredible, getting to know people from different fields other than engineering and engaging with people from different countries with different perspectives.

Also relates to goal 4. Studying in a top university in Asia and engaging with an educational system that, although quite similar to the one present in American universities, still has notable differences. Most importantly, the hands-off nature of education and the freedom that it provides.","I was always intrigued by Asia, and having the opportunity to visit one of the leading forces in the continent was a great experience in showing me future opportunities for my career. The tech industry here is dominated by local giants Samsung, Naver, and Kakao; very different from what we are used to in the West with Californian companies essentially having control over the industry. So it was interesting to see just how different people’s relationship to something as global as the internet is in other countries. Nevertheless, many of these companies have not had breakthroughs elsewhere, whether it is for lack of trying or failed attempts, it seems like there could be opportunities to explore in connecting South Korean companies to other markets. I was particularly inspired by a South Korean friend who told me about an acquaintance who learned Portuguese and how that got him an executive job. So leveraging my ever growing global expertise is sure to bear fruit in the future.",2/18/2023,6/22/2023,https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do,"4y5tytzy0WJZkQHUt1DOe4D-6IeBDtO5w6DpoH3N_1w=_plaintext_638184363319741885.jpg

Computer Science Mentoring,Leadership Development,Student Activity/Event/Club,"I mentored Brazilian high school students who wish to pursue an education in STEM (particularly in Computer Science) and are considering taking their bachelor’s abroad for free. I provided one-on-one sessions with students where I taught them basic programming and I also organized and presented a talk about my experience studying abroad and how to prepare for it.
 ","Relates to goal 4 of the sustainable development goals (Quality Education). By assisting high schoolers and giving them a taste for programming and computer science, I am helping them broaden their horizons and consider more options for their future. I am also helping them tackle another huge challenge faced by Brazilians, studying abroad, since there are barely any resources available for Brazilians to get information about pursuing their academic goals in other countries (and the little that exists is locked behind predatory and expensive services). I like to believe I am making even a small difference in their lives and setting these students up for greater success in the future. ","I never thought of myself as an educator, but giving these students advice, and teaching them practical knowledge has been very fulfilling. It has made me appreciate the impact that education has had on my life and how important it truly is in propelling people up. I still have plans to become a software engineer and not necessarily a teacher, but now I want to take the experiences I had and share them with others, so that they learn from my successes and also failures. I hope that sometime in the (probably) distant future, when I get enough experience in the field I can start mentoring others in a professional setting as well. ",1/10/2023,7/6/2023,"The end date I put in is for the last presentation I have scheduled, in which I will be talking about my experience in South Korea. I hope to keep the program going for as long as I can however.


Supplemental information: While I was in Brazil I did a mix of online and in-person meetings (mostly online synchronously), and here in South Korea I am doing it fully online and mostly asynchronously where I give students programming problems (some easy small assignments) and I give them feedback.

Composites and Advanced Materials Expo CAMX 2022,Professional Development,Conference,"Attended the SAMPE Awards Ceremony & Dinner and participated in many conference sessions through out, establishing industry connectinos and meeting new friends/students from other universities/schools. This event certainly impacted my world view and made more certain about my career path. ","Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns: learned about circular economy in wind energy infrastructure repurposing and recycling, recycled carbon fiber, and the relation between recycling, sustainability, and net-zero. 

Goal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all: learned in the net-zero seminar about the government's effort to ensure robustness and flexibility in power grids of the future, and also about how clean energy transition may soon be a political topic. 

Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation: Learned about how advanced materials could be used in architecture and construction. One interesting example is the Pinkbar, a lightweight glass fiber equivalent of steel bars in concrete that is more eco-friendly in production and easier to transport onsite. It can be used in floors and foundations. In addition, I learned about advanced biomaterials that could act as the exterior of buildings and promote local biodiversity. 

Goal 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels: learned about the field of forensic engineering. The keynote speaker of the session introduced non-destructive testing using micro-CT as a noval evidence-collection method in law. An accurate diagnosis of structure failure will help assign liability for incidents to different parties and ensure justice in court.   ","This experience made me reinterrogate many assumptions underlying modern sustainability efforts. Like, who is the main driver behind corporate energy transition (executive board, customers, consumers?), is recycling really sustainable? (depends on the quality of the product, level of recycling, and transportation exhaust), and how could the material industry contribute to the net-zero action (could suppliers affect buyer decisions)?

At the same time, I was introduced to the vast world of materials with many career and research opportunities.

VIP Sixth Sense,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,"The team works on a wearable assistive walking aid for visually impaired people. It uses computer vision to identify obstacles in the environment and relay the location and distance of the obstacles to the wearer using an array of haptic motors. It can also guide the wearer to specific objects in the view using object detection. I'm in the experimental design subteam. This semester, we wrote and edited the IRB document and protocol of observational study to submit to NYU Langone. In addition, I researched eye-tracking technology and devised strategies for extrapolating information from the collected data. I was also heavily involved in the construction and reinforcement of block obstacles that will be used in testing, spending on average 1.5 hours in the lab every week. ","UN Goals 3: Health and Wellbeing: people with visual impairment have additional difficulties in navigating the environment.

Indonesia Service Trip,Commitment to Service,"Study Abroad,Volunteer Event/Experience","Traveled to Indonesia to complete a 2 weeks service program focused on sustainability, anthropology, and circular economy. Classroom topics included Bahasa language learning, cultural identities, low vs. high context societies, models of cultural norms, and conflict management styles. Field activities included circular economy learning with Teras Hijau Project, and community education learning in Sakola Motekar. ","4 Quality Education

4.4 Sakola Motekar focuses on practical learning of the youth. Through this, I learned the various methods of informal and practical education employed to make the kids well-versed in music, technology, social communication, and languages. 

4.7 Teras Hijau has taught me many systematic methods of assessing sustainability and many channels to educate more people on the concept of circular economy. It employs the concepts of tokenized waste management, and renewal of waste products, and has recycling projects that are close to the people's culture, making them more acceptable. These effective concepts can also be applied to my future endeavors. 

12 Responsible Consumption and Production

12.5 In Teras Hijau and Sakola, we taught local children and people the ideas of sustainability and identified several ways the infrastructures can be improved to allow more responsible consumption and production practices. ","The life cycle impact assessment tool taught through the Teras Hijau Project is useful for many aspects of my career since I now can characterize and assess the environmental impact of any production/manufacturing process. This relates to my current internship since it is a startup with a strong drive for sustainability and in need of a systematic assessment of its manufacturing processes. Further, the various challenges and conflicts identified at Sakola Motekar shed light on the greater dilemma of education in under-developed regions of the world; these dilemmas include the lack of governmental funding and the local's lack of business know-how to acquire proper sponsorship and donation for up-scaling the non-profit. On this trip, I was exposed to so many interesting ways of life and culture, learning about the country's day and nightlife, its industrial composition, its music and dances, and most importantly, its wonderful people. I like the speech given by the co-founder of Sakola Motekar at the end of the program. It went something like this: the standard of living in Sakola Motekar is low, and so is its people's standard of happiness.

Mechanical Engineering Consultant at Kanda Industries,Global Competency,"Employment/Job,Internship","Joined a startup focused on plant fiber composite materials last September. Company roles included consulting, establishing relationships with suppliers in China and Korea, producing technical documentation including testing reports and technical datasheets (TDS), and representing the engineering department in meetings with professors from North Carolina State University NCSU. ","12 Sustainable Consumption and Production

This again relates to the idea of circular economy and sustainability. The most significant polution of the manufacturing process for Karken Fiber (the companies main material) comes from its chemical treatment steps, but the end product is completely bio-degradable since it's almost 100% eco-materials, including hemp fibers and bio-epoxy resins. Unidirectional product lines can also be recycled into matted fiber reinforcement if treated with thermoplastic resin. 

7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Karken Fiber has great potential as a candidate for wind turbine blades since plant-based composites are much lighter and stronger flexually. In fact, I'm currently working closely with Arc Industries on prototyping with our material for their wind turbine products. ","This experience was my first introduction to the formal world of business, where I gained vocabulary in business development and niche fields of engineering, like textile engineering. The field of textiles is filled with jargon and confusing terminologies/units, which all got me super confused at first. However, I was able to understand those conventions and unspoken facts in the industry with extensive research. If the information is very obscure, I would ask the professors at NCSU the lead of the business team for guidance, in turn, learning so much from them. Now I'm very well-versed in the languages of textile, composites, and manufacturing, both in English and Chinese (as the machine designers are based in China). This experience would prepare me for pursuing similar positions in the future.

Furthermore, this was also the first time I communicated with customers and suppliers in China. I found out that they have very different ways of conducting business compared to the US, particularly, it was a lot more formal and fast-paced. Further, they have a different set of business laws, which made many legal processes a first time to many members of our team. However, growing up in China gave me certain exposure to its social norms and communication styles. Thus, I was the main poc with the machine designers in China.

The level of cultural exposure I gained from this experience is how I justify putting it under the Global window.",10/5/2023,5/25/2024,https://kanda.industries/,"WhatsApp Image 2024-01-21 at 01.30.06_1d2e8f3a.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/4Y0xDShBcENBpwoNNsqfvQ/66cNevdFw40sRVxIZRFFehwmo5jZnnHJJoqjcXNS_onzcb-O1vBjZDMBxuEqmiDIEdLd0GV1QE2SmZQ1upTyif43BRiOF2AbiySevFh-02vmLkqslsVEozTevvQrVkONaVpyqKrd6VnrH1zDbtVv6GFqyRTXPleAkO0pT30C7byUN7LD2Fm1PRfYdyLKTTbM/pTmfrailrADs9XgwYBq_NzM3jyZE946bsu9kWpv7vBk),Screenshot 2024-01-21 023354.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/6AWh0EIkw81nVCmnwU90Sg/O6sxwI5POj7OlL62gT2a8EYPHGcPtr76KHPqtqfKh-gsBtCi6vkr90ZpY-AnTNA8x95s6Jd1MUDCkhWiyow7o0rJFcSfteyruWHVdHPfJmn5OYvN-vpBNPdjAahYQYVZW8RpbHw5ge-yWeAIFze3eTrjL2mZFMoCnb4-jBd3Yag/d6Ayl4yXkAdbpKQRIwJ5WM2pnU2h4wZtyxi5dC8CssA)","(please do not share the photos and documents I post here with others, per company request.

Climate Week NYU Kickoff,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Volunteered at the Climate Week kickoff event at Governor’s Island. Main responsibilities included setting up tables, transporting materials and equipment, and hosting events and booths.","Mainly Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. This event took place on Governor’s Island on a sunny day with a lot of visitors and vacationers. The venue was packed with volunteers and participants. I helped host a booth on Climate Clock, a countdown timer indicating the time left until the global average temperature rises 1.5 C above pre-industrialization levels. Informative captions also accompanied the timer on the scope and severity of climate change. This event and climate clock both helped to raise awareness for climate change and pointed out solid steps forward. ","This event really connects to my focus on health because I learned how climate change disproportionally affects underdeveloped regions of the world. Extreme temperatures most acutely harm countries located on the equator that are less technologically developed to implement universally available indoor cooling. With the blurring of seasons, certain diseases that become dormant over the cooler months like Lyme disease and West Nile virus have become more rampant. Having an equal political say on climate-related policies is also important. Thus, I also connected with a student lobbying organization that trains K-12 and college students to lobby against big corporations for climate action.

Feminism and STEM VIP Team,Professional Development,Student Activity/Event/Club,"I participated in the Feminism and STEM VIP Team for the Fall 2023 semester (which was put on pause for the time bring) where we had weekly meetings to present findings and progress, as well as discuss feminist issues in society. We learned about feminist research and about different methods of research; Dr. Glabau even brought in Professor Lindsey Anderberg who runs the archival research at Tandon, which allowed me to become familiar with the library resources and further connect to departments on campus. I decided to join an existing research project of Dr. Glabau’s (before the team was put on pause) on baby advice books that would focus on interview transcription with software MAXDA, and I further researched the topic by using literature reviews and primary sources to learn about “The Ministry of Motherhood.” I would have looked into motherhood in different cultures and the different technologies being developed for mothers and in the future maybe I will get the chance to build a 3D baby monitoring system with the help of the Makerspace. ","Gender equality is one of the UN’s top Sustainable Development Goals and the Feminism and STEM VIP Team clearly connects with this goal. The team worked to create an intersectional and inclusive environment that used language that was intentional and set up a space that focused on bridging the gap of inequality between genders. We discussed how despite the fact that on paper, especially in America, there is the language of equality, but in the systems of the public sphere there exists a gap that can be backed up by data. During our time on this team, we read passages from Invisible Woman by Caroline Criado Perez and in the very first chapter she wrote about how the snow-cleaning system was negatively impacting the productivity and efficiency of the daily lives of women and children, as well as men, by clearing the roads first, then the sidewalks. We further discussed how the differences in treatment between genders may be subtle in some cases, but impact the quality of life of women, such as the fact women are more likely to die from a car crash because the features of a majority of cars were originally designed with a male in mind. This team worked to learn about the existing literature and to amplify women’s voices in a STEM school and to specifically conduct research in an avenue of your choice that is focused on social reproduction, feminine pedagogy, women in STEM, or any feminist topic to present in the annually VIP Team exhibition. We were also focused on good health and well-being, the third UN Goal,  as we were curating different prototypes of technology that can be built to combat the gap between technology designed for women. The goal of this team aligns with the UN’s goal of improving the quality of life of all people and to work to ensure a healthy life with equal access/opportunity. ","When I decided to join this VIP Team it was to explore an interest of mine with no other reason than just being passionate about feminism in STEM and its presence in societal spaces in the health domain. Being in an “echo chamber of engineering” at Tandon creates this illusion of a “formula” that must followed to achieve success and is extremely male-dominant driven. Additionally, there is this exclusion when it comes to Tandon with smaller majors being phased out (which tend to include a large female population from observation alone) and there is a need to amplify women’s voices in STEM and I feel very proud to have been a part of this team. This team allowed me to intersect all of my interests in one space, compounding my interests in data science/technology and research with motherhood. This experience truly allowed me to build a stronger community at NYU and gave me outlets to other departments at Tandon and allowed me to build a mentorship network with Dr. Glabau.",9/5/2023,12/15/2023,https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/feminism-and-stem-gy,,N/A,Health,The VIP Teams are widely discussed in Tandon.,"United States, NY, Brooklyn",No,Fall/Winter Sophomore
Ghana Travel Colloquium with NYU MLK Scholars Program,Global Competency,Special Program,"With the NYU MLK Scholars Program, I traveled to Ghana from January 9th-January 16th, leaving early to travel to NYUAD, visiting three cities to immerse ourselves in Ghanian culture, learn about PanAfricanism, and interact with the local people and meet faculty and entrepreneurs. It is intentionally a travel colloquium, not an alternative break trip as service break trips are extremely limited and short and oftentimes it may create more work for organizations; the purpose of the Ghana trip was to focus on global learning, learn more about identities, network, and learn more about history first hand by visiting the Cape Coast Dungeons and the Last Bath River.","This travel colloquium relates to EVERY UN Sustainable Development Goal and relates to Providing Access to Clean Water and Advance Health Informatics, which are NAE Grand Challenges. More specifically, this travel colloquium connects to reduced inequalities & peace, justice, and strong institutions as one of Ghana's motifs is the Akan Adinkra Symbol of the spider web which symbolizes the interconnectedness of the community and its emphasis on oral history -- the importance of learning the history and sharing with others. To learn and grow and educate and to never let the stories die. Spider webs can withstand rain or sunshine and so can Ghana. Ghana is still a fairly young country and is still developing, we were instructed to NEVER use the tap water to brush our teeth and to not buy street food, as well as required to take malaria medication. At the University of Ghana, I learned about the research being done on malaria and COVID-19, as well as the new resources being created for a community that is comprised of around 20% of deaf individuals, where hearing loss was once associated with sorcery. Also, the struggle to translate research into public policy, as well as Dr. Lily's research in Breast Cancer and her organization Nofo and how Breast Cancer specifically in Black women is the least researched and is the most aggressive and is severely impacting their communities, and yet most of the research done in breast cancer is done with a majority Caucasian demographic. Moreover, visiting the Cape Coast Dungeons has been the most harrowing experience of my life, to stand in a room that is hot as hell where hundreds of Black men and women were forced to inhabit for 2-3 weeks before leaving through the Door of No Return and it is unimaginable. The floors were no longer brick, stained from years of blood, urine, feces, sweat -- we were standing on the DNA of the enslaved people. These dungeons are often referred to as castles because standing on the outside it is absolutely beautiful, the breeze from the ocean is delightful and the scenery of the Assin Masno Slave River Site is breathtaking and yet many drowned themselves in the river and many men were killed for resisting in the dungeons and women were raped and far too many died from miscarrying. These sites are evidence of history, it tells a story of strength and perseverance of the Black African Diaspora and as Malcolm X said it best, ""None of us are equal, until we are all equal"" and the guide said it best that we have a duty to ourselves and each other to share these stories to learn and grow. Ghana was the most beautiful country and there is so much rich history and culture and Africa tells the story of a continent that is so far divided, but would be so much stronger united and the roots of colonialism still hold strong, but I hold faith in the development of the UN Goals and perhaps one day I will spend a portion of my life in Ghana advocating for their communities and demanding equality and justice.","This experience greatly increased my passion for decolonization and the empowerment of the African diaspora in its past, present, and future. I am so honored to have visited Ghana and culturally immerse myself and make connections with the people to possibly return to this beautiful country. I may come and go but I hope the work I get to do in the future lasts lifetimes. Additionally, I am considering spending time working with the faculty at the University of Ghana to help with the research and possibly do a J-term study abroad at NYU Accra. Moreover, professionally and academically this experience helped me grow with entrepreneurship, as I was able to meet with different businesswomen and high school students of Ghana and learned more about marketing and was able to support local businesses.

NYUAD Study Aboard,Global Competency,Study Abroad,For my sophomore spring semester I studied abroad at the NYUAD location in the United Arab Emirates. I spent the semester challenging myself to take risks and immersing myself in Emirati culture.,"At NYUAD I took classes and attended lectures given on sustainability, while also casually/briefly working in Professor Teo’s lab, where I worked on building a Raspberry Pi camera for immunobiology in space, in hopes of an innovative future. In one of the lectures I have attended I learned about concrete techniques in order to build more sustainable buildings. Within the activities I participated in I worked on developing Sustainable Cities and Communities, UN Goal 12. Furthermore, on a personal level this experience relates to UN Sustainable Goal four, Quality Education, as this opportunity allowed me to connect on with people internationally and learn about different schooling systems and opportunities in the UAE.","Overall, this experience allowed me to grow as an individual and experience life independently for the first time. Professionally, I attended my first career fair hosted by the CDC at NYUAD and I did not have major interest in most of the companies that were at the fair; however this exposed me to what makes you stand out from the crowd and what kind of questions to ask. It removed the anxiety of “selling myself” to a recruiter and now I know exactly what I would do differently and feel a lot more prepared for future conferences. Additionally, as the academic rigor of NYUAD was harder than what I have experienced at Tandon I learned to advocate for myself and to genuinely use my resources, no longer intimidated by the “Office Hours by Appt Only” I no longer hesitate to reach out to my professor. I also had the opportunity to do tensile testing and use real industry machines like the INSTROM at one of NYUAD’s labs, which I haven’t been able to do at Tandon. On a personal level I believe I have to grow to understand who I am as a person and because of being a new country over the past four months of approaching and mingling with new people I can approach and talk to almost anyone. I learned more about myself in context of others and in the absence of others as well. My experience was dynamic, but I made friends and memories that I hope stay with me forever.",1/18/2024,5/18/2024,,"IMG_2554.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/USZAJS9pTxSCBIszeUwAyQ/x6H4hkEo0H-5rEsQqNBbm41PVLu5lDg630lB65YKP2LBI2o5gZYRasLzoQAfQEmdoK2Yvxqz4mN_4SbnHDpix5HKOpC5FHK8eOVbBsXhXkmxHhLbCaKdf-Mkhkp6meNfnb4qUVZYwz4sqrqxk8dbN1xXj32gDUwOsoo0cJDS2zo/GOMLUyUpRATxRkzVeJmWj7ug5wwObFsSt3_uLZXxeUU),IMG_2209.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/k_l2fEW5f5qSzLBLggwf0Q/onVjlPn6w0K3xmbstpf_WJgPIMU_1hFlC14tEJX4-z6SVP8ni1l_i7qu0DEsgeGtCEMkfPubBS3mPQjqbt7UkQXc5Kkrdld5LqFuWldwgcEUJ4lw0PQW5DeytfNBKJw9bNVbHYKWMtieb7-alK7oqwGVouEH9aPbIVFnMiX0ArI/n1ChlaVdMyRhitzGyCZzezdYWzZf_ThofHbRpKGPSXE),IMG_1081.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/pyBl5LJ1cWlNa3bcDT0Xtg/UWQQKbb9CFo90uSb1qXjWKM7GZqDEv07YKtDCBODCpwo7hrV_aaArEkLOEuEswSTdPVNTeoobI7UrLUsDj4vpI893Npsdxbc81RA5Oq1WL4HG1K7GXjD-ESpuZeXRBn4zp6xYCn6Xz9CY6Dh5PHw52htRvMTz5AJ4vzg51CIAg0/pC5jrhswItaLObJWKlGOMNYTNKp3iOaD032hbCAISsA),IMG_7040.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/lXrgjD_4VZczB2aLtKhyYg/UJMtVAgSliKL0PT41CthqFvEEMVjcV0G-gVFypCtmfzFeuuQDlc75C1s9A_JRvlqE_-MZmYe3TOVUI1i3BN-Qmjo3em_mt6VHEieTd15gS0iBL1e6LiHhUlUdo0AODqRzbwT3DJ_uk4iEZ4YTzdP6VBgYrDdpvhI02vCxhN3CG0/jKO1TJhdVDiyeH48hez1cy0DzHFU_1jtUjVfWj5QzDI),IMG_7035.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/lgUPBIOm75-i9U8MnhWGOg/yzs6_1VSj2Ilv2ftrg1aJ-CBLyqlJooOMOp4jSkasMiGpNr7hR5KoNk1LKV-8Kk93nV-E6VkSO3RnKILaUzseVffyrxAgNROaxaqoZBLHcmGi0teJX9zJQiz-CJNt8wSDKPIRIYDb4glTqcmFnzls-ivJwyVMpu8HPUwyoC21wE/7ZFdu4P6kVRSOIfGZqUumBIrJzOP6II56sYZCU-SChk),IMG_9207.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/ApEHcRILE3mYehVAW8bn2g/Lfrd1ZBPqWj5npS4R16-b3sIvkE2YATMj_SV1JwpLIwPSMc-5wEtZETzRGHUNjVev_cwEMQD1Gj36ORpLBddh-d1CJnLTMh3v9kCBgZHoGhnZ1RkNIx34JWp1WxscklY186NlmPZ-QK5HyW2VBSjyAtWYchYPpzbtJYiQgBN2wo/Z5CsDqpYOEdbFyJuhpBBVBDUnv6_SOSips1NKxCWUPE)","At Ezba with a camel!, My friends & I taking the elevator to the library, Sexton Square during Hag Al Laila, My name displayed to take my from DXB to NYUAD, my flight to Dubai!, An event I attended about Spacetoon","Sustainability, Emerging Media, Health",NYU,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Yes,Spring/Summer Sophomore

NYU Summer Research (UGSRP),Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,"For UGSRP I worked under Professor Xin Wang where I built a control system for Polarized Optical Microscopy. I spent the summer learning control theory and custom designing a model to 3D print, while also learning new software systems: MathLab and Simulink.","My research relates to sustainability and health, UN Goals three and twelve. My lab ran two experiments in which both require temperature control systems and the lab’s setup required inefficient manual adjustments, wasting time and money. The lab initially purchased a control system, but it was incompatible with tools/materials used in the lab. To mitigate these issues and reduce costs, I began developing a thermo-control system for the microscope. I custom-designed and 3D-printed a heating unit using Fusion360, printed at NYU Tandon Makerspace, costing $1 to produce and took 30 minutes to print, with a total expenditure of $12. The design is cost-efficient, sustainable, and easily replaceable, requiring minimal ABS plastic. Additionally, these experiments are used in nanobiology and have significant health applications. They allow for the examination of how molecules change, crucial in understanding such as Alzehmier’s and Parkinson’s to help develop therapies to address these diseases and more.","Before UGSRP I knew I liked doing research but after this summer my desire to do research strengthened and I am very grateful to have been given this opportunity. Within this research experience I had no PhD student above me so I was able to set the pace of my research with guidance under Professor Wang, which I know is in contrast of the experience of several of my peers. I was able to make my own choices this summer, which gave me power to shape my own experience. I was able to fully custom-design a model on a software of my choice and I choose Fusion360, even though I am more comfortable with SOLIDWORKS. This was the first time I designed a product, instead of just extruding sketches on my screen. I had to be intentional and precise. I struggled immensely with the 3D printing, at one point I wanted to give up. I’m glad I didn’t because I was able to think critically and overcome the challenge by speaking to my professor.

Visiting Student Semester Undergraduate Research Assistantship,Professional Development,Research/Lab Work,"During my semester abroad, I was able to engage in research that focused on the advancement of the process to make 3D cell configurations, otherwise known as spheroids. These configurations are critical to the development of drug screening and much more due to their ability to maintain the cell-cell adhesion seen in real tissues. I learned the process to perform subcultures and make spheroids using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).","Cell spheroids are three-dimensional cell cultures that more accurately mimic human tissues compared to traditional two-dimensional cultures. This advancement can improve drug screening accuracy and efficacy, leading to more effective treatments and safer drugs. Enhanced drug development processes contribute to better health outcomes, part of the Good Health and Well-being UN Sustainable Development Goal. This technology can potentially accelerate the development of therapies for various diseases, including those that disproportionately affect lower-income populations.  Cell spheroids offer a more accurate and complex model for drug testing, leading to better understanding and prediction of drug interactions and effects, which is an essential part to the NAE Grand Challenge to Advance Health Informatics","Gaining practical lab experience with cell spheroids offers valuable insights into cutting-edge research techniques and technologies. This hands-on experience is crucial for developing technical skills in cell culture and experimental design which are essential for a career in medicine or biomedical research.

Silverman Laboratory Assistant,Academic Excellence,Research/Lab Work,"I worked for around 8 hours each week as an assistant in the lab and participated in group meetings with the entire Silverman lab (which comprised of Professor Silverman and 3 other PhD students beyond Luana, who I worked with this semester). In the lab, I was responsible for creating solutions of pesticides in water and managing model photodegradation experiments, as well as learning proper protocol for the lab work we were doing. I learned about different solutions, how to use certain machines, and more - this culminated in myself and my lab partner Cecilia presenting at a Research Expo at Tandon. ","I believe my work at the lab best connects to UN SDG number 11, which is Sustainable Cities and Communities (""make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."") Pesticides are widely used all over the world for crop production - but a major issue that arises from their use is their persistence in natural environments, especially water. Contaminated water has the potential to cause illness for both animals and humans. Therefore, our study of the potential of (different) pesticides in water to photodegrade is especially important in understanding and mitigating harm. By gaining a better understanding of which pesticides are least persistence (just one of the hopes of this research) we have the ability to obtain results that could - in the future - potentially inform public information campaigns and lead to the regulation of certain pesticides in hopes of protecting public health and communities. ","I learned so much more about how experiments are conducted, how data is gathered and analyzed, and how research works in general. At times, it was definitely extremely difficult to manage - especially on the days we sometimes worked until 10pm, and it became harder to minimize contamination and mistakes during experiments. At the same time, the experience was so valuable because although I learned that I do not think I want to pursue lab work, I now have a lot of respect for it and learned so much about my mentor's work. I also learned a lot about lab and experiment management, which was very difficult at times - I gained a lot of skills in terms of handling the more difficult parts of lab work, and managing analysis of results, which I believe to be extremely useful skills. Environmental Engineering experience can be hard to come by, and I am so grateful for this experience because it opened my eyes to new aspects of Environmental Engineers, especially as Luana was so open to teaching us about the intricacies of her work. I truly believe that learning so much on the job has made me more adaptable and will be extremely helpful as I look for more professional opportunities.

GLASS Event Team Member,Leadership Development,"Research/Lab Work,Special Program","Ashley, Fabiha, and I were all part of the GLASS Event team, and as such planned, promoted, and managed events geared toward students studying away at NYU Tandon for the semester. There was a total of three events - Six Flags in October (Halloween themed), Friendsgiving in November, and seeing Chicago on Broadway in December (a unique local experience). We worked to best enrich the experience for the visiting students and facilitate cultural exchange, which meant managing our budget well, coordinating with Mohamed, and socializing with the students. ","The GLASS Event Team and the work we did best connects to UN SDG 17 (""Partnership for the Goals"".) Our events allowed exchange students to interact with each other, the GLASS community, and NYC in ways they likely weren't able to at other events, since we had a flexible budget and truly aimed to ensure their experience and inclusion was prioritized. Quite a few students who came to the first event returned for the second two, and this allowed us to get to know each other - programs like this are vital to create long-term connections that aid in building a global perspective. These connections are also vital as many students go on to work for international systems that benefit from students who have connections with a wide variety of global perspectives. Building partnerships for goals start early on - college is the best time to be creating these connections and building the foundation for future partnerships. 
 ","While Fabiha took the lead on the first event, I took the lead on the second event, Friendsgiving. This meant researching a variety of locations to host the event, diverse food offerings with good reviews, and planning and ordering the decor, while trying to keep everything within budget, and then communicating all our options to the group to ensure we all had a say on the final decisions. I think in terms of personal development, this experience really helped my personal understanding of budgeting and how to recoup as much as possible when plans change, as well as just my ability to compromise to keep costs reasonable even if you have a large budget. In the case of this event, we had a lot of people cancel their RSVP, when our goal for RSVPs hadn't even been met. I was able to lessen the amount of food ordered and change the organization of the tables to ensure the room still felt full, and changed the vibe to be a little more intimate. This really worked out well for us, but it took a lot of communication and last minute adjustments. Additionally, for the other two events, just keeping track of and managing such a large group added to my skillset. For example, for Six Flags, I had to communicate with so many people as people cancelled their RSVPs and I had to offer up those tickets, or answer people that had questions in a timely manner. We also had to ensure we kept a constant head count and didn't leave anyone behind, which required pretty much constant engagement, especially as I had one of the p-cards for the Six Flags event and paid and kept receipts for each person's meal.

Abu Dhabi Sophomore Spring Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,I studied away in Abu Dhabi for the entirety of my Sophomore Spring semester. A majority of my cohort also went to Abu Dhabi for my term. ,"My study abroad trip to Abu Dhabi relates to UN SDG’s 4 and 17 - quality education and partnership for the goals. Not only was I able to gain a perspective on Civil Engineering in a different part of the world, I also had access to professors from all over the world, who contributed their experiences in various countries. Professors with a multitude of experiences allowed for both a more expansive education and allowed us to begin building a world with partnerships to encourage this and foster it into something greater. I hope for these connections aid me as I learn how to become a global civil engineer, and how I can engage with other countries as a future professional. ","This experience pushed me academically and personally, being my first time out of the country and experiencing a different system of education and different system of units. It also inspired new professional goals, as I realized that I do hope for my future work to eventually be global and humanitarian-focused. I found that I was able to learn about sustainability in unexpected places, because of how much climate change and extreme development impacts life in the UAE - conversations around both are happening in nearly every class, whether engineering or writing or drama.

Eaton Powering Business Worldwide Internship,Professional Development,Internship,"This internship solidified my decision to pursue a career in high voltage and power distribution after completing my undergraduate studies. The Field Service Engineers at the site were incredibly knowledgeable, and they shared valuable insights and tips that significantly enhanced my understanding of the field.","Working alongside a power company goes hand in hand with the UN goal of “affordable and clean energy.” Two other goals that fall under the category of this internship are “sustainable cities and communities” and “industry, innovation, and infrastructure.” Since this internship consisted of physical hands on work with the manufacturing process of the electrical “switchgear” but also the installment. Every piece of equipment went through a series of teams in order to ensure the final product is efficient for the specific application it will be used. So, overall, since the internship dealt with supplying power efficiently to large corporations, the underlying word for all 3 of these UN goals is sustainability.","Professionally, this internship was incredibly valuable for me. As an electrical engineering student, the variety of career paths available can make choosing one challenging. While I had an interest in high voltage and power distribution coming out of high school, I wasn’t entirely certain about it. This internship, however, confirmed that this is the direction I want to pursue after undergrad.

Tandon hAQathon,Academic Excellence,Other,"I participated in the Tandon AI/Quantum hAQathon, where my team placed 2nd. I also placed top 3 by grades in the qualifying assignments out of 300+ registrants. Our team, team QuiQ, used quantum algorithms to optimize subway routing.","This related to the UN's ninth goal, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. Optimized subway routes and stops that serve the maximum number of people will make public transportation a more viable and enjoyable experience for many New Yorkers. Currently, the subway system is lacking, leading to less carbon-efficient options being chosen in many cases. An example of this is trying to travel from Downtown Brooklyn to Williamsburg, which requires that you route through Manhattan and take a long detour.","This introduced me to quantum computing, which was an area I had no familiarity with beforehand. It also showed me how linear algebra and probability are used in quantum mechanics and gave me a better understanding of superposition and entanglement. I was also able to meet and connect with my peers not only at Tandon but also at CAS.

NSF REU in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute,Professional Development,"Research/Lab Work,Internship","I participated in a research experience for undergraduates that focused on applied mathematics in industry. Six students were divided into two groups of three and given research projects defined and sponsored by industry partners. During the nine-week program, my collaborators, academic advisors, and I worked closely with our industry advisor from Collins Aerospace on the research project given to us. My research specifically focused on algorithms for updating the transitive closure of a graph and the application of graph modeling to system reliability engineering.","This experience is most closely related to UN Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The goal of our research is to help ensure the safety and reliability of newly developed systems, which is critical in engineering reliable infrastructure. Specifically, my work focused on system interdependence and failure propagation; an example of my work’s application is modeling the different points of failure for a bridge and how these failures can cause each other, allowing reliability engineers to spot high-risk failures that they can then mitigate.","This experience changed my mind about graduate school. I was previously leaning towards entering industry after I graduate, but I now plan to pursue a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I was able to experience the creativity and autonomy that research allows for, which has become the main reason for my interest in entering a research career.

GLASS Event Team for Exchange Students ,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"I worked with 2 other GLASS members to create 3 events this semester to immerse exchange students at Tandon into American culture. We managed funds, contacted companies for group orders, planned decorations, and met regularly to come up with engaging events for the exchange students to have the best study abroad experience.","Leading the GLASS event team most deeply connects to UN Sustainable Development Goal 17, which is ""Partnership for the Goals"". Through this opportunity, I created events which allowed international exchange students to get the most out of the New York City experience while also helping them build stronger bonds with local Tandon students as well as each other. After the first event, I had noticed some of the exchange students who had been regularly signing up, and I was able to get to know them better and learn more about what their lives were like back at home. Interconnectedness in such a way promotes problem solving since the best solutions are found with varying perspectives, and I was privileged enough to interact with students from many different backgrounds and speak with them on various issues. It is important to maintain and support exchange programs so that universal systems to tackle difficult issues such as problems in health care and the environment can be addressed from different angles. ","Being a part of the GLASS Event Team helped me to advance my professional development goals as I was tasked to contact different companies to ensure that the event would run smoothly. For instance, for our first event, we had planned to take the exchange students on a day long trip to Six Flags. We had approximately 2-3 weeks to plan the event and get in touch with Six Flags, so we all had to work quickly to ensure that we are taking everything into account. I had been in contact with case managers and representatives from the head office at Six Flags for 2 weeks to plan a group order and recieve tax exemption from our purchases, as well as coordinate discounts on meal plans and parking while remaining under a budget. On the day of the trip, we broke the students up into groups and coordinated with them throughout the day using iMessage to ensure that we remained in contact with them while also giving each group the freedom to explore the adventure park. Our second event was a Friendsgiving dinner in which we did research on different venues to see which would be the most ideal in terms of budgeting and services offered, and we had booked a game lounge to promote socializing at the event. We also ordered a wide range of food types ranging from Palestinian to Nigerian to Chinese food to offer the students a chance to experience foods from different cultures. Our final event was a Broadway show to Chicago for the students to enjoy, with an additional trip to a nearby cheesecake restaurant so that the students could get world famous cheesecake before going home to add to the true American experience. For each event, we had to communicate effectively with students and Mohamed, as well as brainstorm ideas to make sure that the students were getting the most out of each experience. Personally, after writing emails to promote the event, coordinating with companies and learning how to make quick decisions on a budget, and finding ways to help other students feel more included, I feel like I have grown a lot through this opportunity.

Tandon Writing Partners Program ,Leadership Development,Volunteer Event/Experience,"I volunteered as a writing tutor for students at Tandon who have difficulty with writing. This program is centered around international students who are not confident in their skills in English. I met with the same 6 students weekly throughout the semester and helped them progress through their writing assignments in class by teaching them about effective ways to write, and had them write some goals they wanted to accomplish in writing this semester as I guided them to work on these goals. ","The tutoring that I did this semester relates to the Quality Education UN Sustainable Development Goals, which is defined as “ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all”. By working with international students throughout the semester, I aimed to bridge the language barrier that they felt conflicted by in their writing by introducing simple exercises and providing them with guidance regularly. I am interested in working on Quality Education during my time in GLASS because I believe that education is important to make resources more accessible to larger groups of individuals. Tutoring international students and helping them work on their writing skills allows them to communicate more effectively, which would therefore grant more lifelong learning opportunities, as learning to communicate in a new language is a valuable skill that gives people a wider range of opportunities. I believe that tutoring is a major source of promoting equitable learning since it is a significant resource that can help people in the long term. Through my work this semester with these students, I have helped them construct essays in a clear and concise manner, and had various conversations with them to guide their thought processes to help them further progress in their English skills. ","This tutoring position has helped me academically since it gave me the opportunity to teach other students about how to communicate effectively through their writing, while also being a learning experience for me as a novice in tutoring. I would save and plan resources that I found that would be helpful for the students to reference, and I would have to think about exercises befitting the students’ weekly concerns on the spot. I would hold sessions that were around 45 minutes to an hour with them, and because of the limited time that we had together, I had to ensure that they were getting the most out of each session. I also had to write a report summarizing our sessions after we met and reiterate advice that I provided. This role allowed me to become more comfortable with teaching and thinking about new ways to make seemingly difficult subjects seem more simple and interesting. I made an effort to make my students comfortable and ensure that the activities that I assigned them helped them in the long term. This also gave me practice to explain concepts and writing techniques effectively, and realize common patterns and errors in writing that I may have made in the past myself.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"While studying away at NYU Abu Dhabi, I was given the chance to immerse myself in a unique educational experience while also exploring the vibrant culture of the UAE. Through NYU Abu Dhabi, I was able to participate in numerous unique club activities and get to know students from many different countries, and through this, I discovered many different perspectives in education and lifestyles. ","As a student who has only known the American education system my whole life, studying abroad in the UAE has given me a firsthand understanding of the importance of promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions, which aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 16. Experiencing the diverse cultures and perspectives here has shown me how critical it is to foster inclusive societies. The population of the UAE consists of over 200 nationalities, and through NYU Abu Dhabi I feel like I got to learn a lot more about how people from countries such as China, India, Montenegro, and many more have different experiences in education and can maintain peaceful lifestyles abroad. I've seen how different communities work together to create a peaceful environment, which inspires me to contribute to building similar values back in New York. My experience in Abu Dhabi has made me more aware of global challenges and the role I can play in promoting peace and justice in my own community. Overall, my time in the UAE has connected me to Sustainable Development Goal 16 by highlighting the importance of collaboration and understanding in achieving sustainable peace.","Studying abroad taught me how to overcome many challenges, including navigating living on my own in a different country. In terms of personal development, I learned how to make better use of my resources, and deal with practical issues such as figuring out cell phone plans, maintaining a proper work life balance, and communicating even with language barriers. I was also able to hone my communication skills by bargaining in the markets I went to, which was a completely new experience for me. I began to do more research on typical prices for items to be able to bargain, and doing so had also given me more confidence in communicating as a foreigner. While in the UAE, a Muslim majority country, I felt more comfortable as a Muslim American, and began to embrace that side of me a lot more than I had while living in New York. I learned a lot more about myself through the club activities I participated in such as Bollywood dancing classes , the people I spoke to, and the places I went. I also developed a lot more academically as studying abroad in the UAE was my first time studying away from my family and friends from home, which gave me the opportunity to take a lot more time to myself and better understand my learning styles. I had a lot more time that I didn’t have to use worrying about commuting or other responsibilities that I may have had back home, so I used the time to better understand how to make the best use of my time. Instead of spending the entire day studying like I would in New York, I began to space out my sessions and leave ample time to explore outside of classes, which allowed me to learn a lot more from my classes. I also really appreciated that classes in NYU Abu Dhabi were limited to around 15 people, keeping the instruction very personal.",1/16/2024,5/17/2024,,"IMG_2368.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/o7KVIGQs_vErjFDk9KYu4g/QPouxP8GvbFY3G9FulzZYbtlXs7MP1U-PkxWUYkiT5kwA8gHFeA9X0z9bwOuTzsweuMTh1TgLf6ze4AmpqHTnUq20JKW3HeNrfrIL7genqIibB1d7gzmDOb7x0Ec5cIRg3wS5iXGWdtZo2Cm-F1LRQ3t8cJpJabmTmmh9vS0u4k/Md9GC8MK4spaidzqXy9Mj2fFSTsWb0HGdgpyXn8YQfg),IMG_2699.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/Hp5R2suzHW2vPBhXq6YoBQ/l3nzKgDoIm5kt-M0hxp9T2B3GIlWpAZ83UlcVdiuthLH8lfa-mDWSUZs7nwUfCO2XtZ0Cew4uf5JTtKn26KxzG9LKAvKyIlgaKiT3AGmMZNFWtQaJQqTEJ9IZsiW4fGPF1j8XuxsIVlT0auhK4KQ1G5P89mS3aBCOnGdtJwYpzY/TD0jFtjQTmjIBHrCixfF3yrv_qKew6VuQIJfZLElbUM),IMG_3996.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/M-aQNMN7MwJcCPta_C81Lg/lPK1k9eyFKpI-K_yBQ33nKoPQg1tbeQZ5RqI-HBeAMLSVllI6gMuKbPKGR-IhQK51SbB6hNNtZDmpDVBSe4mCa48Ww0UB8Bv9sCBid6k71VWv1LBCHXIck4yQTvVLLe5qdsKxXqnSDvs8rQnTmkQ9rQp1veRPfD24X4gtjJ1uGg/iTAahqGouwxSy-qivB1s2ojMjg73uYWXsYmkrnfa7VA),IMG_4101.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/9fa0PY9GCNVwSuKGqT_FCA/qbyVV2Pv9y9opJOffKVXJRd15ngqWc3K5GJntWF7vtmxBbFkKTh4a2wnsxZRObHU_NLfypUCx1axi9gsd5hanYDmx7RNwKYZ44LXDSDQjhYiLa9BC3a4EibArIAJvVR3yKMirUK1T-Y4BYhdaMTowJR3XQpiH4DPACDaKnSNYOI/T6jXUQ_qtDmS3F18MFmkr2QEB83vUCpn9otqKOhfw-M),IMG_4586.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/rs-CwR29JM-XHJK7awAqzA/4atd67LiEY2josBrxEmunZe0byKjLagkyHHFa6G9lEEs_b9IytD2goObGYEl89ZaPW0__OhFaR_hqcOy-qyFs3O868IvRlHUMoapTqHWt-eJD4vU1q_FWiR7cvmbRpbNazGtUfDyVKOm_AnV4C2n1hQhvrfiqFDDk2b3IKlUNUk/AB4rWWtP1G4eTEficZ9xpxkDwW6dy6bX7jznLxTKqlE),IMG_5642.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/SFdw3qrpaF78ECQ3Q57fcg/o5eyDC4UauJo6t-WWqECimcvkgYRniBsYH-9bJaWK19JyGW_pH_L5z87_qAWgPN3XOm9ybA5VLNQBL7G3cwxGxf_rvddoDCrZrYC5PoTWP22LCj1eiwYtFhy0NYjiJQo92it4NEyyVHDXJrO4LRB34bBP8U5CUGoyouZcMkrQW0/HuXV62cOAXpzPtjqFf7DPppzo1b0DcImLk7-8SQ5WTM),IMG_6123.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/kE417jwRv2nKh51VM6878g/I6ejA4HjELhp0sXUxiyCJKWvMLptkuZ6HvCnquFYofgSzDR05-u6FN3x5msKIc-BLk2ouOlfTvpKbjs3MqhlCTw87oqLaN8wmWW56c7kTlE8YaTcOf-p5N5KB7irHrx3mWAFmdniZf5crG3yRElKtYF8DO8PLV_x87dwgALXRmk/xXbST9FiUZUKKWR2e1kTUqMHeYezBe32bSEwypIWYFI),IMG_8613.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/qn0a_q1v_eSKT9dfCkprFQ/w7igXD4i7umxwLOxE8s5gb9GrhMhhIWm0ywEV1lSy3YB_xR7HuBed5bMyFJ8DEYbbDlCmwkxCTOVe3hJP2vEb3VH0RrQHfnOoCI_J1k2k1sdIvyHMj5Ejv3mNTY9BLv6HN91YKWu18uL1qNfmXtU-qgKVFVZ8FQI3K0QEnawFi8/Glxd-ezoMLUtbmLZeC6ixl8QL091Z1lyw6ikbKgpvuA),IMG_9441.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/4RCXyhgFhsMGIlFm013Nmg/9RqcwNexwa0BN93ex_4-VIeZe8kjWNSEIax1Deoo2GYsua5sCpFwRpk9sXpGFTGK5tSTdUMk-SCAg7NXBe2fu614CW3Hg_L2Of1YgouoSyOcXo4HNLrzRzzitacRk2CdBk6QjMIIdI-6tPsH38gyKauuh95Zd-IJ3dTCDEBej9Y/s23oQC3pnzqADr1USMhi81MSs4W_298sIfkl2iwzWCM)","Camel riding in the desert, Visiting Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Taking a day trip to the city of Al Ain, Watching a soccer match on the NYUAD field, Going camping overnight in the desert in Mleiha, Taking a trip to Qasr al Watan, Going to the NYUAD Chancellor’s Iftar during Ramadan, Staying overnight at Ras Al Khaimah, Visiting the Souk",Health," I learned about this opportunity through GLASS as part of the GLASS requirements is to study abroad in your sophomore year spring semester, and NYU Abu Dhabi is known as one of the main NYU campuses, so I decided to study there. ","NYU Abu Dhabi, Saadiyat Island ",Yes,Spring/Summer Sophomore 
NYU Abu Dhabi Research Apprenticeship at the Jha Lab (Genetic Heritage Group),Professional Development,Research/Lab Work,"I completed a semester of research at NYU Abu Dhabi, focusing on isolating bacteria from saliva samples and fermented foods. Through this period, I practiced DNA extractions, microscopy training to generate certain types of images of samples, collecting and preserving samples, taking inventory, and analyzing growth and inhibition patterns through cross cultures. I also learned how to perform data analysis using R programming, which is typically used in the scientific research field. ","The research that I had conducted with my mentor at NYU Abu Dhabi most closely aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, which is Good Health and Well-Being. The intention behind the various types of studies done were all to better understand what we as humans consume and how that may affect our overall well being. As part of my research, I would attend weekly workshops to practice data analysis using R, and we would use data sets collected from previous studies that were done in Nepal to assess the gut microbiome of pregnant women in different areas in Nepal ranging from urban areas to more isolated rural areas. We would assess the gut microbiome through the data collected, observing how it changes before and after pregnancy. In terms of wet lab experience, I would collect saliva samples from different individuals on media that I would create, and isolate the colonies that would form from the initial samples. I learned how to take monocultures and cocultures with different strains of bacteria. From this, I was able to assess which strains of bacteria inhibit and promote growth for one another, and make judgements on which types of bacteria may lead to decay in oral health or potentially have a connection to unhealthier eating habits, which are said to be genetic to a degree. ","As this was my first wet lab experience, I was able to learn many techniques that I could use in future research projects. My research background mainly consisted of data analysis and writing scientific research papers, but working as a Research Assistant at NYU Abu Dhabi under the Genetic Heritage Group gave me the opportunity to get training in various data collection techniques. I was able to collect ingredients to make my own media (LB, skim milk, SAB and MRS) and I operated the autoclave, and poured the mixtures into plates to be able to use them. I communicated with many researchers at the Experimental Research Building for guidance, and learned many helpful techniques with creating media. I also learned how to isolate bacteria for mono cultures and cocultures. I was able to use different streaking techniques to obtain the best results, and looked at many different case examples to be able to ascertain the relationship between different strains of bacteria (growth vs. inhibition).",1/16/2024,5/17/2024,"https://www.geneticheritage.org/

HUMAN’INSA Artificial Intelligence Track at INSA Lyon,Global Competency,Special Program,"I participated in a 3 week short program at INSA Lyon known as the HUMAN’INSA program, which consisted of two tracks. Track 1 set a focus on Artificial Intelligence and using Python to generate and understand simple AI models, and Track 2, which was French Language and Cross-Cultural Communication allowed me to immerse myself in the culture of France and learn more about how to communicate with individuals that come from different backgrounds. ","The HUMAN’INSA program most closely relates to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, which is Quality Education. By combining the technical skills provided by an Artificial Intelligence course along with more practical skills in French and Cross-Cultural communication, I was able to learn a lot about the French education system, their culture, and how locals live. There were a small group of individuals participating in this program, and yet there was a wide variety among our group. Many students were from China and South Korea, a vast minority including myself from America, and individuals from Denmark, Australia, and Pakistan. From all the people that I met, especially in our Cross-Cultural Communications class, I was able to learn a lot about the education systems and different cultural norms from many different countries. From this, I feel like I have a better understanding of what works and what doesn’t in different education systems, and this is knowledge that I hope to apply in the future when considering more equitable quality education.","My experience at INSA Lyon had helped me grow academically and personally. While this opportunity was short term, it was my second study abroad experience, and I was able to apply a lot of the practical knowledge that I obtained my first time studying away to facilitate an easier experience for myself. I experienced some personal difficulties, such as navigating French cuisine with my personal dietary restrictions while having a language barrier. I was able to overcome this challenge by learning more French to hold basic conversations, as most locals I had spoken to did not speak English, but were very kind and patient with me. I also pushed myself out of my comfort zone by taking a Computer Science oriented class in another country while being a Biomolecular Science major. While I only had a basic understanding of Python from classes that I had taken at Tandon, I did a lot of self teaching to fully understand my lectures, and my professors were also very accommodating as my class consisted of people from many different levels in Computer Science. In terms of academic development, I feel a lot more comfortable using Python from taking this course, which was also helpful to me because Python is a common language that is heavily used in the research field. I also hope that with the rise in AI in our daily lives, I will be able to implement an AI model in dental research. ",6/26/2024,7/12/2024,https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/human-insa,"IMG_1036.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/6z7OzBWQOImeojyZ7sULDg/ZloxQZTaLLbtuoxPEQJPLGsCd7dW1ocdyKK8Kjen2zu1GyzVuF1DZ3F8pRX8Eb0a-gvv04Ug2Ko6c0Za-RpVIxPi0aFwKO1EU-KUGCk5-UNnvHg2bhFFOsdl-ftDQ0pprXr6z7QjP9SCBKQwGpKmMxSL_MOBud1iqoguy8cl9WM/WsESbzdIwdOSG2AwrK9zvnNP6KxMpwMo-aavN29QZAg),IMG_1567.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/6ooA07aWSve3VwfRLc-S6Q/Q-nvHYOTm0BayxnXNrHoafhvHjAkVtpoT8PacJ5WeneSgtBxKDhXLAhTQiwa1URO6DWHqlh1jUviKFaH1TePxDg3u40bj2mSh4GcNAxGOmiTDiVCmENxgInpl6KRPWrtGoDv_6QuVpLnHpynSzlvUcP7kmOfMbzQLmTYucPZOFQ/GH7rxnj2_YW7_FW9-z0ksdsuHMZJ6SinZNeNjgZaPd0),View recent photos.jpeg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/-o7dWHeZMt1pYls_ktP7jw/xqc35G-PuqTQkOdXho-U0p_BCF-gMuaaUBNGv1ob09KlUkP6-vRTTbK96u2ubvUihJrz6xZdDbJm1kAONx0Gomt_6ckBLj8D5P2Yw_TnQU9q8C5bK7EXympzqolLuz70dDFTSjLQxeygfLIBSBdpR_HxAZGYCpGtdAqKtiZnMHs/rqufFcy-4rsF0CPlcthbFCbOQudfxngQQFB8NBn98TI),View_recent_photos_2.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/sKIUNcd3VzlfhvqpKrzYPA/ArHOi9psXB-U56WFY8k45neNoSTgYxCKBke7Z6gIbD2NbiV2jN7Pq9nmVWoG58IPxlwGRkXF32k4gA88ISb3xvGQNU-OdjKXzmKJZa0D_cr4cYLMHhX1YQNsiyYAIqg6xzzoGcq9wviQTCnRA3HUMtFv3dd6FNnM1BvUjOzG0rcs_A-ET8Usq2AIV9NnC-Fo/M_ted3ERFvqTbbGWz8n_cY9zzA6c3CwspxYsi6uvG5g)","Exploring the city of Villeurbanne near campus, visiting the city of Annecy, going on a day trip with the HUMAN’INSA program to the city of Oingt, Food from an authentic French restaurant.

"The 22nd World Congress on Dental Traumatology in Tokyo, Japan ",Professional Development,Conference," I attended the 22nd World Congress on Dental Traumatology in Tokyo, Japan to receive a global perspective on topics that interest me in relation to my career. From this experience, I was able to network with professors and researchers from all over the world, and also attend lectures on issues in the field of dentistry that seem to be universal, and take a look at how individuals from different nations may have similar or different approaches in addressing such issues. "," My participation in the World Congress of Dental Traumatology reflects UN Sustainability Goal 3, which is Good Health and Well-Being. I would personally like to pursue a career in dentistry, and going to this conference allowed me to obtain a global perspective on dental traumatology. I was able to see a lot of cases and observe how different professionals would diagnose and solve issues. The exchange of knowledge with professionals from diverse backgrounds emphasized the importance of equitable access to quality dental care, reinforcing the need to address health disparities. This experience not only deepened my commitment to pursuing a career in dentistry but also highlighted the role of oral health in achieving broader health and well-being outcomes globally.","Going to the WCDT allowed me to develop on a professional level. As someone who is interested in pursuing dentistry, I was grateful to have the opportunity to see various cases that cannot be seen in everyday settings. I currently volunteer at a dental office, and I do not see nearly as many trauma cases as I did at the conference, so coming here gave me a chance to gain exposure to other scenarios. As a pre-dental student, I feel that exposure is one of the most important aspects of becoming a dentist because it would allow me to address problems more comfortably and effectively in the future. Additionally, the networking opportunities provided by the congress could have allowed me to build connections with professionals from around the world, which is invaluable for collaboration and mentorship as I progress in my dental career.

NYU Tandon Prehealth x GLASS Alternative Break Trip in Sri Lanka,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"I spent two weeks in Galle, Sri Lanka shadowing at a hospital and participating in various service activities. I also participated in several activities centered around cultural immersion such as visiting a Buddhist temple, Galle Fort, and the Elephant Trail safari.","Participating in the Service Trip to Sri Lanka related to UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, which is Good Health and Well-being. I spent the first week in Sri Lanka volunteering at a hospital, specifically in the maxillofacial surgery wing. I observed how the hospital had free healthcare, but very limited supplies. It was also interesting to see how clinical notes are taken on paper, as there were very little available technological resources. I observed how dental care is approached in a different country, and how the patient’s well-being is prioritized but also how sacrifices may need to be made due to the lack of resources. For instance, anesthesia has to be rationed in certain wings to prioritize for children and larger operations. During my second week, I observed how alternative treatments are done in an Ayurvedic hospital, and volunteered to assist at a turtle hatchery, which relates to UN Sustainable Development Goal 14, Life Below Water. ","Participating in the Alternative Break Service Trip in Sri Lanka allowed me to fulfill some of my professional and personal goals. On a professional level, I was able to witness how a hospital in a different country with limited resources at their disposal, and I saw how the surgeons attempted to navigate through such issues. Because I was also in the maxillofacial wing, I got to witness various types of surgeries that I had never even considered to be a part of general dentistry, and yet in Sri Lanka, operations that involve jaw reconstruction may fall under the category of general dentistry in Sri Lanka. There are also different requirements to become a dentist between Sri Lanka and America, as you only need 4 years in dental school in Sri Lanka, but you need both a bachelor's degree and a degree as a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry (DMD). Furthermore, after speaking to the dentists in Sri Lanka, I learned that there are less restrictions when operating as a student in Sri Lanka, so dentists will generally obtain experience while performing on patients at a younger age. Learning more about maxillofacial surgeries and looking at oral cancers and trauma cases also tied into what I had learned at the World Congress on Dental Traumatology conference that I had gone to in Japan a month prior to this trip. On a personal level, I appreciated that being in Sri Lanka truly gave me the opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and try new things. For one, I was able to bargain more comfortably when going into markets because of the skills that I had learned during my time in the UAE, which is still a somewhat foreign skill to me. I also got the chance to learn how to surf, which was nerve wracking at first, but after taking a leap of faith I was able to surf comfortably and realized that I should take advantage of all the opportunities that I am granted even if they may be nerve wracking at some points. On a similar note, I was able to go on a hike for the first time, and we got to see a lot of wildlife and tread unique terrain while being in the rainforest. I also learned more about Buddhism from a temple visit, and about alternative treatments in an Ayurvedic hospital.

I frequently had to lead diverse groups of people in club initiatives or logistical activities.","This role most closely relates to the goal of peace, justice, and strong institutions. In correlation with other student organizations, such as the NYU Students for Justice in Palestine, we hosted various events to educate and push for equality, freedom, and justice for people all over the world. Through these events we were able to spread information and unify people with similar goals for the world. Thus, we were able to bring humanity one step closer to achieving peace, justice, and strong institutions.","As someone hoping to explore finance as a career path, managing and making decisions with the 1000 dollar budget we had was a unique experience that I cannot obtain from the classroom. I was able to learn about both dealing with larger sums of money as well as working with other organizations (NYU) to manage and explain our purchases.

Quantum Programming Hackathon,Academic Excellence,"Special Course,Special Program,Student Activity/Event/Club",I participated in a 2 week long course on quantum computing and received two certificates upon completion. I was then advanced to a competitive hackathon where I worked with a team to develop a quantum solution to a sustainability issue.,"The most relatable UN Goals for this experience are Climate Action and Sustainable Cities and Communities. We were tasked with creating a software/program that utilized quantum computing to solve an issue relating to climate/sustainability in a way that classical computing could not. Our solution optimized the packing and routes of the supply chain industry and distribution of goods through trucks. Semi trucks, as one of the leading contributors to pollution in the US, would drive far less miles under the implementation of our solution. 

In general, quantum computing has the potential to achieve most, if not all, of the UN Goals since the ability to run real-world simulations and process huge amounts of data gives it an advantage over classical computing and allows us to try very many solutions to very many problems.","After I did well in the assignments and coursework before the competition, I was awarded certifications for basic quantum computing. I was able to leverage this in my internship searches as it is a unique skill that not many applicants will possess. Furthermore, the hackathon and course was so intriguing to me that I am planning on completing the new minor in quantum science at Tandon.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"For the second semester of my sophomore year, I studied away at NYU Abu Dhabi in the UAE. The entire program ran from January to May, and I was able to take interesting classes, some of which I would not have been able to take in New York. Namely, I took Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, Electricity and Magnetism, Computational Physics, Futsal, and a research assistantship in the Astroparticle Physics Lab at NYUAD. Being in the UAE was a great learning experience both culturally and academically, and the geographical location of Abu Dhabi allowed me to travel to different regions and further discover other cultures.","My study away experience allowed me to learn more about the systems behind the United Nations Sustainable development goals. Specifically, I was able to explore the 4th goal of quality education, 9th goal of industry, innovation, and infrastructure, and the 11th goal of sustainable cities and communities. During my time in Abu Dhabi I was able to learn about how education is approached in different parts of the world, as taking classes in a different continent was an informative experience. For the UN goal of industry, innovation, and infrastructure, I learned much from the mass development occurring in the UAE, as the country has developed from a desert into one of the most technologically and infrastructurally advanced nations in the world in under 50 years. Similarly, witnessing construction near campus and understanding sustainability goals of the UAE from the Museum of the Future in Dubai made me more aware of specificities regarding the United Nations 11th goal of sustainable cities and communities.","Being in the Emirates was a very informative experience, specifically in regards to my career path. I was able to take classes that are difficult to find at Tandon, such as Computational Physics. Through this class I became aware of the simulation and computational research side of physics, rather than the theoretical side, and thus opened up opportunities for me that I was previously unaware of. Furthermore, my experience conducting research at the Astroparticle Physics Lab at NYUAD was another informative experience where I learned first hand what a career in academia entails.

I worked on a project to detect a new dark matter particle known as Axioms. I was involved in the creation of the experiment, and so I  made progress on creating a model that will facilitate the dark matter detection.","One of the NAE Grand Challenges is to Engineer the Tools of Scientific Discovery. During my research I worked on creating a tool that will facilitate the detection of dark matter, which accounts for an estimated 80% of the matter in our universe. Discoveries towards fields of physics that are still very theoretical, such as Dark Matter, will contribute massively towards understanding our universe and how it works. Furthermore, our lab was also working on analyzing the water pollution levels in and around the Emirates which contributes towards the United Nations’ 14th goal of preserving life below water.","My experience conducting research at the Astroparticle Physics Lab at NYUAD was an informative experience where I learned first hand what a career in academia entails.

Vietnam Summer: Digital Twin to Tackle Sustainable Development Issues in Smart Cities in Hanoi,Global Competency,"Study Abroad,Special Course,Special Program","I did a study away program in Hanoi, Vietnam, this summer. The program focused on sustainable cities and using digital twin technology to model traffic flow, relating to the United Nations eleventh goal of building sustainable and resilient cities. Throughout the project, we learned about Vietnamese culture, specifically historical and linguistic elements.","One of the biggest challenges the UN is tackling is making cities more sustainable and resilient. Hanoi is one of these cities experiencing detrimental effects from air pollution, which is having a runoff effect on the surrounding rural environments. Hanoi hosts some of the worst levels of air pollution worldwide and Vietnam suffers around 70,000 deaths per year due to pollution. Our work focused on reducing air pollution in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, by optimizing street traffic to reduce emissions by gas powered vehicles.","I often mentioned how I am interested in both data/computer science and sustainability but I had little experience in anything that connects the two. However, In Hanoi, we were able to utilize digital twin simulations, based largely on mathematics and physics principles (my major), to tackle sustainability issues in the city.

For example, one of the issues discussed was postfire debris flow, which was how after a forest fire, runoff from rainfall can cause floods filled with sediment which are much more harmful than just a normal flood.","This relates to the 13th UN sustainability challenge of climate. This challenge pertains to the effects of climate change on the environment and each part of the webinar showed some degree of this. It was mentioned that the debris flows were caused by wildfires and even made them stronger, especially those on the west coast which were caused by global warming. There were different solutions offered as well to combat this with some being predicting where these debris flows would happen and trying to stop them before they occured.","At first, I was not expecting the event to be as engaging as it was since I wish to focus on construction/project management and never gave that much attention to the geotechnical aspect of civil. However, after the webinar, I realized how intertwined the fields within civil are since one of the first topics discussed was the Sanibel Causeway. The causeway is essentially a large highway/bridge that already incorporates transportation and general civil practices but includes geotechnical engineering in the conversation with how Hurricane Ian impacted it.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"For this component, I went to Abu Dhabi with other students studying away as a requirement for GLASS and an opportunity to expand my horizons. I did take some major-specific courses, but I was also able to enjoy the different culture.","When I went to Dubai, I noticed that there were no unhoused people in such a big city which confused me since it is not uncommon to see them in New York. This makes me wonder how this applies to the first goal of no poverty and what methods were used to allow this so it could eventually be applied to New York as well. Furthermore, I was very interested in the infrastructure of the cities since it is a big city like NY, but it is not built for rain. If I were to go back in the future for work, I could apply the ninth goal of industry, innovation, and infrastructure to make such an advanced city more livable. ","Being in AD has changed my perspectives in a plethora of ways. In terms of my professional goals, I always assumed that I would work in NY since I would always be able to work on buildings plus it is close to my home and family. However, being outside of the States made me realize that I was limiting myself to the vast amount of available opportunities outside and that I would consider working there in the future. For academics, it was similar to NY, but I focused more on electives while I was in AD, so it was a nice break from all the required courses.

UGSRP ARISE: Innovations in Steel Construction,Professional Development,Research/Lab Work,"For this component, I spent ten weeks doing research under Professor Laefer where I worked in a sub-team that focused on understanding the steel life cycle. The overall goal was to see how the Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC), a connector, could be introduced to the construction sector where other teams designed it and got the opinions of companies in the construction sector using surveys. ","The ISC relates to the 11th challenge of sustainable cities and communities as well as the 12th challenge of responsible consumption and production since the implementation would make it easier to keep track of the movement of steel. The biggest issue with the construction industry is that there are many key players which makes quantifying their costs (environmental and economic) almost impossible. Furthermore, the main change to the construction industry that comes with the ISC is the ability to reuse steel instead of only recycling it. This in turn would reduce the environmental costs of recycling","Through this program, I was able to get an understanding of what working in future internships or offices would be like. There were many instances where I had to use skills that I have acquired in my courses (for example, EG) such as working in diverse teams and presentations. In addition, it was constantly improving my soft skills with weekly check-ins and meetings.

Additionally, this effort represents an example of global partnership, as it involves collaboration with NYU to achieve broader sustainability goals.","Studying at NYU Abu Dhabi was a significant personal growth experience for me. I was immersed in a new culture and was surprised by the diversity in the UAE. Experiencing Ramadan was especially eye-opening, as I saw how different cultures and religions can peacefully coexist. The country is grounded on a foundation of respect and acceptance, allowing more immigrants and expatriates in the country than the local population.

Fiji Construction and Development Volunteer Opportunity,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"Over the summer, I had the opportunity of doing a solo volunteer trip to Viti Levu, Fiji. It was through an online program named Volunteer HQ however upon arrival, I was a part of the team labeled Green Lion. It was a great overall experience as I had the opportunity to help with the construction of an elementary school for the local children in the area. I was also given the opportunity to explore Fijian culture and even learn a new language. ","This relates to the UN Sustainable Development goals of Infrastructure, Industry and Innovation, and quality education. Both are easily applicable due to the tasks that I partook in Fiji. For example, I helped create a walkway throughout the school (with a cover to block the rain) while also collecting dozens of sand bags to help make concrete to further expand the school “campus.” While helping build these structures, I was able to collaborate with the other volunteers I connected with to teach the students English and religious songs which helped them learn basic phrases. I was able to have free time with the kids where they wanted me to swing them in the air and chase them around the school which was also a great experience. ","I feel this has had a strong impact on both my professional and personal development goals. I love to help others and I love meeting new people around the world. Through this volunteer program, the people that I have connected and volunteered with have connections to various other programs that I most definitely have interest in. I met two people, ones name is Bobby and the other Chris, that live on complete opposite sides of the world. I intend to visit Chris as I would love to visit Japan to learn more of the culture and community. In terms of my personal goals, being able to see kids happy from the work that I was doing, see kids laugh at the fact that I can lift them up and swing them with ease, see kids want to take a picture with me to remember me even after I leave, is truly the most impactful experience of my trip to Fiji.

NYU Florence Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"During my study abroad experience at NYU Florence, I immersed myself in Italian culture, history, and language, while also exploring global issues through a local lens. This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of Italy’s role in addressing global challenges and how local actions can have a broader impact.","My time in Florence aligns closely with several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, the focus on cultural immersion and language learning ties directly into Goal 4: Quality Education, emphasizing lifelong learning and global citizenship. Additionally, understanding the cultural nuances and religious influences in Florence has highlighted the importance of Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, as it underscores the need for greater cultural diversity and inclusion within the community. Finally, the experience of living in a city that thrives on tourism has reinforced the principles of Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, particularly in the context of sustainable tourism practices that respect local cultures and contribute to the local economy.","Learning Italian in Florence has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my study abroad experience. The consistency of Italian classes three times a week, coupled with the City Lab sessions where we interacted with local Florentines, provided an immersive environment that significantly enhanced my language skills. This hands-on approach to language learning, where classroom knowledge was immediately applied in real-life contexts, not only accelerated my fluency but also fostered a deeper cultural understanding. The process of mastering a new language, particularly one with such close ties to my existing knowledge of Romance languages, has been both challenging and fulfilling. It has allowed me to connect more authentically with the people around me and to fully appreciate the cultural richness that Florence offers.

Moreover, my experience in Florence has offered insights into the city’s unique cultural landscape, particularly its communication styles and religious influences. The contrast between the more tactile Italian communication style and the more reserved American approach was a fascinating cultural observation. Additionally, the pervasive influence of Catholicism in Florence, evident in its numerous churches and religious art, highlighted the city’s deep-rooted historical and religious identity. However, it also brought to light the lack of cultural diversity in Florence, a stark difference from the multicultural environment I’m accustomed to in New York. This realization has deepened my understanding of cultural homogeneity and its impact on a city’s identity. The experience has reinforced my commitment to embracing diversity and has inspired me to contribute to initiatives that promote cultural inclusivity in both local and global contexts.",1/14/2024,5/14/2024,,"Cinque Terre - GLASS.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/57fVvKPRXzLRNHswiMfJAw/7HjLD0eKXQLa3BAWACcyDw7x3niXWL1pbVZyWRPzZR1PffnX4zwuEu3AhqK8JiIpQ79PcmFpp575NnzgZATVrzdP0f6b2XwhcelzrwVbVJLQK0XmFKATsZrqUOY0vjRbypih2E9JpOxsLQ1FBOvYP4IOzWRay9nogBlFZICNLl8/PK4ASCYsHhEPcS7BT_RpgR5QFjRXnwYGBGccWtTcG5U),Pisa - GLASS.JPG (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/Eeu4lbZ5G7vf7Qe_0BvGkQ/5snkdBQ45adgzGKSUGfcZ_dwqzVhrNCeWjyEMkrAehi3d36lERzy8Rs4fj-H9A-CfjvIqJYFJpPWxwnDlvim-7W0uKh1XmbaOvGY7peXl0y7tIszSiH1f1fE32-KL4cUNgdDSX7vPG3Jy8r6AhJ6524afs89-jwtbg15EeU5Qkk/KB_sHqOdb5wGlQXkRJh1pRGqK6hp-4mLLDI8UcuZuTo),Venice - GLASS.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/33/33/1728007200000/Bsq6iNsz3rTtSdG-9KAORQ/4jAcXcNfpOAAzlTAgBizMw57XJ4JmK8NlLN9oej7jnnE4ySm4om7J0OycnzsTceH5Uj770R1R4o5pfLUNOemCY3Kt9VAfNI5LSKCQejXlTO2WpDUMa_oVk48s2_UXoRVkjUJ_R5zW4RaATjKKdunAT0_0Xx1YYvV2khgET5ZZyA/sauN4uoFSADsvdOs9nYEDtsgdw8IJAX7H8C9o_D0wWY)","Cinque Terre, Italy // Elena, Maria and Audrey (left to right) by the Tower of Pisa, Italy // Canal in Venice, Italy","Sustainability, Urban",NYU,"Florence, Italy",Yes,Spring/Summer Sophomore

VIP Digital Media Intellect,Academic Excellence,Student Activity/Event/Club,"For this experience, I helped to conduct research to gain insights on user engagement and market trends, as we analyzed the posts statistics on instagram. We helped to brainstorm, develop, and schedule the dissemination of social media content throughout the semester to ensure content and visual cohesion. 
       ","This experience teaches me how media can be quantifiable and measurable, and these data can be used to assess the impact of various initiatives related to the SDG 12 of responsible consumption and production. For example, in the future when I create a Cloud Closet software, I could embed functions to track carbon footsteps from purchasing clothes and to guide consumer behavior towards more sustainable ways. Additionally it helped me gain insights on how organizations innovate and develop ideas related to digital marketing and online engagement, aligning with the SDG 9. This project-based VIP even connects various stakeholders to work together and share best practices, involving creators, planners, strategists, supervisors, faculties, and administrative authorities, which speaks to the SDG 17 - partnership for goals. ","Learning about digital media and how to target specific audiences through customer profiling can provide me with the skills to raise awareness about the SDGs by spreading information to the right audiences. In some ways, I also learned that collaborative work is essential to develop effective campaigns, because only then, you can gain persepctives from various people. I also learned how in the professional media world, you need to schedule consistent posts and content to be released, so these project management skills are really essential for what I want to do in the future such as building my own sustainable business and how I should manage the marketing. I will need to think about the various social platforms I use, and how to organize the types of content I want to release. We also talked about how we can make purposeful content, such as being able to communicate what each major does in a way that is easy to understand and not complicated to explain. I think this taught me that sometimes communicating sustainability goals also doesn't have to be that complex. If we make these content simple and easy to digest, we're able to more effectively communicate with our audience about our mission and purpose.

I organized all the drive resources, I created a centralized Canva account where we can organize and share the graphics we make, and people have easy access to it. I created a master event timeline google sheets to streamline communication between the various Brotherhood, Service, and Professional chairs with the Marketing and Digital Design team. ","This leadership role connects to the quality education SDG 11 as firstly, the role of the graphic design team is to aid communication between the event planners and the audience/attendees, so we have to make attractive graphics to encourage students to attend our events. Some events I made or assisted graphics for include the Professional Research Panel, the Portfolio Workshop, SASE X THETA Conference workshop. Without these flyers, students wouldn't know the events that could help them develop professionally. The flyers including the Midterm Destress event and Pie-A-Theta fundraiser contribute to the good health and wellbeing SDG 3, as these help to aid the wellbeing of students in the school. Moreover, by streamlining communication processes via google sheets and Canva workspaces, this relates to the SDG 17 of partnership for the goals. I could have very easily just continued the old inefficient ways of communication but I wanted it to be less stressful for everyone, make this role easier for whoever takes up this position after me this year, and also create a new and more sustainable method of running these processes. Thus, this is also a very direct way of reducing stress SDG 3, and creating sustainable communities SDG 11. I also delegated various tasks to various people on my digital design committee, where others can design the birthday posts or rush flyers. I did that so everyone had a sense of purpose and contributed something. ","This leadereship opportunity definitely made me feel like I contributed something to the organization in a big and meaningful way. I left a legacy and cultivated a collaborative environment that I hope will be instilled in the future brothers who take up these roles. More specifically, I felt like I actually refleced the required skills of Project Managers, who's able to effectively communicate with teams, delegate work, follow up on tasks, schedule and organize tasks and processes.

Abu Dhabi Study Abroad,Global Competency,Study Abroad,"I studied away in Abu Dhabi for my spring sophomore year and it was one of the most eye-opening experiences. I got to meet so many different people and it felt a lot more international than when I was in New York. It was also really interesting because I learned that the students there were required to take J-terms, so a lot of them have experienced NYU’s many other different sites. It was also a very cultural experience studying away there. ","Studying abroad relates to SDG 4 of quality education because it provides access to diverse perspectives and different ways of teaching. In Abu dhabi, the classes are also a lot smaller and you get a lot more 1-1 interactions with the teachers. It also relates to SDG 8 of decent work and economic growth because it enhances my cultural understanding and global perspectives, having met a lot of local people and participate in local events. I also learned from my entrepreneurship class that the UAE is promoting a lot of entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, it relates to SDG 17 partnerships for goals, because it fosters connections between the different NYU campuses and being here, I can see how the government partners with educational systems to provide the best for the students. Most of the students are there on full-scholarships, if not, partial aids. ","Professionally, I was able to become more open-minded about the work opportunities there are out there. I was able to network with the students there which is really important because in the future it may be important if I want to do any collaborations with them. It also made me feel a lot more like a true global citizen and prompted me to want to study away in more places in the future. 


Academically, I was exposed to their style of teaching. Honestly speaking, it made me realize I kind of took for granted the math teachers at NYU Tandon, but because I had to self-study so many materials, it definitely changed my study habits. I spent a lot of time in the library and became a lot more proactive in terms of searching for help from other students, going to peer-tutoring, finding resources online. I also learned to reach out to professors and TA’s for additional help and going over my exam corrections. 


Personally, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and talk to a lot of new people and make friends with new people. I noted almost all of the new friends I made and where I met them from, their major, what were some of our conversations.

","Professionally I developed a lot, because I experienced signing in every morning, documenting my work, learning how to do research properly, editing videos. Personally, I learned how to receive constructive criticism better. In the beginning I faced some issues with my boss not giving me clear instructions so I couldn’t deliver what he expected, but I slowly learned to voice the thins I struggle with or need clarification on. I realized I can’t blame him if I don’t be more proactive and ask what I don’t know. I also had to go out of my comfort zone to interview strangers on the streets for our social media.

'girlsnight' Fashion Week Rave for Gaza,Commitment to Service,Volunteer Event/Experience,"On September 6, I threw an event with my friend Chase Dent (NYU Tisch) under our DJ alias ‘girlsnight’. We headlined the event, alongside two other DJ sets, with an advertisement and purpose of donating all profits to the UN World Food Programme in Gaza. We hosted for 293 in attendance.","Goal 2, Zero Hunger, was a large focus of the purpose of our event. All the money raised was sent toward providing access to food for those displaced or affected by living situations in the Gaza Strip. A portion of the event related to Goal 16, Peace/Justice, since we strongly advertised awareness for the tragic situation in Palestine during the entire event. A lot of our announcements and in-person advertising was focused on bringing awareness to the Palestinian people.","Throwing, advertising, cultivating, and playing for the event taught me so many lessons on how to get a message across to the public. Professionally, I had to learn how to build up an official brand front for our DJ duo. I also had to properly set up the ticket distribution page, as well as financial distribution for the entire event.

On a more personal or social level, I learned that throwing events require proper division of responsibilities beforehand, and I ended up running around until I correctly divided up work as the event went on.
